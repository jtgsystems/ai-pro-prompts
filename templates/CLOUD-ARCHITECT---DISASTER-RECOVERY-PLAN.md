### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue 1: Incorrect Backup Configuration**
- **Symptoms:** Backups not running, storage costs high, restore failures.
- **Root Cause:** Misconfigured backup schedules, retention policies, or destination buckets.
- **Solution:** Verify AWS Backup Policies/ Azure Data Factory jobs are correctly set with the right schedule and TTL. Ensure target storage classes are appropriate (e.g., S3 Standard vs Glacier).

**Issue 2: Failover Tests Failing**
- **Symptoms:** Simulated disaster scenarios do not trigger failover or recovery.
- **Root Cause:** Misconfigured DNS health checks, network latency, or inter-region connectivity issues.
- **Solution:** Validate Route 53 / Azure Traffic Manager health check configurations. Conduct ping sweeps between primary and secondary locations to ensure low latency.

**Issue 3: Service Unavailability Post-Failure**
- **Symptoms:** Critical services cannot be accessed after a simulated disaster.
- **Root Cause:** Incomplete DR testing, network segmentation issues, or IAM misconfigurations.
- **Solution:** Perform full-scale tabletop exercises. Ensure all critical endpoints are reachable and IAM policies allow necessary actions.

**Issue 4: Compliance Gaps**
- **Symptoms:** Non-compliance with GDPR/ HIPAA during audit.
- **Root Cause:** Lack of encryption in transit, improper data residency settings, or inadequate logging.
- **Solution:** Use encrypted connections (TLS) for all services. Ensure logs are shipped to a central location meeting compliance standards.
