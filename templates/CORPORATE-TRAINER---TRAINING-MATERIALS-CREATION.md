### Troubleshooting Section
#### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Potential Cause | Recommended Solution |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Low Completion Rates | Boring content or technical issues on delivery platform. | Use interactive elements, conduct accessibility audit, provide technical support resources. |
| High Dropout After Assessment | Assessments too difficult or not aligned with learning outcomes. | Align assessment questions to competencies, use formative assessments for practice before summative testing. |
| Poor Engagement During Modules | Content overwhelming or lacking real-world application. | Break content into microlearning chunks, incorporate case studies and interactive scenarios. |
| Technical Glitches During Delivery | Outdated software or hardware compatibility issues. | Use cross-platform compatible tools (e.g., HTML5), test on target devices prior to rollout. |
| Low Retention of Knowledge | Insufficient reinforcement after training. | Implement spaced repetition techniques, provide performance support tools post-training. |
