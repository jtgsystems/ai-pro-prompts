## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process
**STEP 1: Inventory and Asset Mapping**
- **Action:** Create a detailed inventory of all network devices, categorize them by criticality, and document their current security configuration.  
- **Tools Needed:** Nmap (free), OpenVAS (free), or commercial tools like SolarWinds Device Discovery if budget permits.  
- **Success Criteria:** 100% of assets accounted for with documented status.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing edge devices; not documenting firmware versions.  
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 2: Segment Network Infrastructure**
- **Action:** Divide the network into logical segments based on function (DMZ, internal LAN, IoT). Use VLANs and ACLs to enforce segmentation.  
- **Tools Needed:** Cisco NX-OS CLI for switch configurations; Windows Group Policy for VLAN enforcement on endpoints.  
- **Success Criteria:** No direct east-west traffic between critical zones without a gateway.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overly permissive firewall rules; missing segment updates in documentation.  
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 3: Deploy Endpoint Security**
- **Action:** Install EDR agents on all endpoints, configure baseline detections, and set up automated response for detected threats.  
- **Tools Needed:** CrowdStrike (free tier available), Carbon Black, or open-source alternatives like OSSEC.  
- **Success Criteria:** All endpoints reporting to the central console without manual intervention.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Agents not installed on critical servers; alert fatigue causing missed incidents.  
- **Time Estimate:** 1 month

**STEP 4: Implement Strong Access Controls**
- **Action:** Enforce MFA across all privileged accounts, implement least privilege access policies, and rotate passwords quarterly.  
- **Tools Needed:** Okta (free tier), PhishMe for phishing simulations; RADIUS servers for centralized authentication.  
- **Success Criteria:** All privileged users require MFA; password rotation compliance logged.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Forgotten admin credentials; weak passphrases still used.  
- **Time Estimate:** 3 weeks

**STEP 5: Set Up Real-Time Monitoring**
- **Action:** Deploy an open-source monitoring stack (e.g., Prometheus + Grafana) to visualize network performance and detect anomalies in real-time.  
- **Tools Needed:** Prometheus, Grafana Cloud (free tier), Loki for log aggregation.  
- **Success Criteria:** Alerts triggered on any anomaly >5% deviation from baseline metrics within 1 minute.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing alerts due to incorrect thresholds; storage limits causing logs to overwrite.  
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 6: Integrate Threat Intelligence**
- **Action:** Subscribe to open-source threat feeds (e.g., OpenPhish, Abuse.ch) and integrate them into the SIEM for real-time detection of known threats.  
- **Tools Needed:** OSSEC for log collection; Splunk or ELK Stack for analysis.  
- **Success Criteria:** Threat feed alerts trigger on any known malicious activity within 5 minutes.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Data overload causing false positives; outdated feeds not refreshed regularly.  
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing

**STEP 7: Automate Patch Management**
- **Action:** Deploy an open-source patch management solution (e.g., Ansible with SaltStack) to automate updates for all network devices and endpoints.  
- **Tools Needed:** Ansible, GitOps repository for playbooks; Nmap for inventory.  
- **Success Criteria:** 99% of devices patched within a week of release.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Manual exceptions causing non-compliance; untested automation scripts breaking systems.  
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing

**STEP 8: Harden Network Devices**
- **Action:** Apply CIS benchmarks to all network equipment, disable unnecessary services, and enforce strong passwords.  
- **Tools Needed:** Cisco Works for configuration backups; NCM (Network Configuration Manager) for policy enforcement.  
- **Success Criteria:** All devices pass the CIS benchmark audit without exceptions.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overwrites of configurations causing downtime; missing critical services enabled due to oversight.  
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 9:** Implement Encryption Everywhere
- **Action:** Enforce TLS 1.3 on all web traffic, enable full-disk encryption on laptops, and configure VPNs for remote access.  
- **Tools Needed:** Let's Encrypt (free SSL), BitLocker/Twofish for disk encryption; OpenVPN or WireGuard as VPN solution.  
- **Success Criteria:** All data transmissions encrypted with TLS 1.3; all critical devices encrypted at rest.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Outdated certificates not revoked; insufficient key management causing decryption failures.  
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 10: Develop Incident Response Playbooks**
- **Action:** Create detailed playbooks for ransomware, DDoS attacks, and insider threats based on latest AI-driven threat hunting techniques.  
- **Tools Needed:** Threat Stack or CylancePROTECT for AI-powered threat detection; Confluence for documentation.  
- **Success Criteria:** 24-hour response time to any incident as per playbook steps.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Playbooks not tested in tabletop exercises; incomplete runbooks causing confusion during incidents.  
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing

**STEP 11: Deploy Zero Trust Architecture**
- **Action:** Implement a zero-trust model where all access is verified and authorized based on user identity, device health, and location regardless of network position.  
- **Tools Needed:** Zscaler Private Access (free tier), Palo Alto NGFW for policy enforcement; MFA at every step.  
- **Success Criteria:** All traffic requires explicit authorization even if originating from within the LAN.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overly restrictive policies causing user frustration; missing identity checks in edge devices.  
- **Time Estimate:** 1 month

**STEP 12: Compliance Automation & Reporting**
- **Action:** Use compliance-as-a-code tools to automate audits for PCI-DSS, HIPAA, and GDPR requirements across the network infrastructure.  
- **Tools Needed:** Terraform with Sentinel or Policy-as-Code modules; Cloud Audit Logs for verification.  
- **Success Criteria:** 100% of automated checks pass without manual intervention during weekly compliance scans.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incomplete audit coverage due to missing configuration items; false negatives in policy enforcement.  
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing
