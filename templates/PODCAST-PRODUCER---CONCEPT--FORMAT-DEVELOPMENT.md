- **Time Estimate:** 1 week  

#### STEP 3: Format Development & Episode Blueprinting  
**Action:** Develop a comprehensive format for each chosen concept including episode length, structure (e.g., intro, main segment, outro), and recurring elements (e.g., guest interviews, segments). Create prototype episodes to validate feasibility.  
- **Tools Needed:** Audacity or Adobe Audition for recording prototypes; Notion for document management of formats.  
- **Success Criteria:** At least 5 well-rehearsed prototype episodes approved by the producer.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Underestimating time required for editing and mastering audio files.  
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks
