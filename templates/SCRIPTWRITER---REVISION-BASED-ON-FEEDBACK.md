## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process
**STEP 1: [Script Review]**
- **Action:** Read through the script draft thoroughly, annotating sections that require changes based on stakeholder feedback.
- **Tools Needed:** Pen and paper or a digital annotation tool like Adobe Reader.
- **Success Criteria:** All feedback is annotated with references to specific scenes or lines.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking minor edits due to focus on major issues.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours.

**STEP 2: [Feedback Categorization]**
- **Action:** Organize feedback into categories (e.g., pacing, character development, dialogue).
- **Tools Needed:** Spreadsheet software or project management tool like Trello.
- **Success Criteria:** Each type of feedback is listed with corresponding script sections.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing out on important notes due to disorganization.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours.

**STEP 3: [Initial Revision Draft]**
- **Action:** Create a first draft revision, addressing all high-priority issues identified in the annotated script.
- **Tools Needed:** Word processor (e.g., LibreOffice Writer).
- **Success Criteria:** A revised version of the script is completed with major structural changes.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Making superficial edits without ensuring story integrity.
- **Time Estimate:** 8 hours.

**STEP 4: [Peer Review]**
- **Action:** Share the initial revision draft with trusted peers or mentors for additional feedback.
- **Tools Needed:** Email platform, shared drive (e.g., Google Drive).
- **Success Criteria:** Colleagues provide actionable feedback and suggest further revisions.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking suggestions due to writer's block.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours.

**STEP 5: [Final Revision]**
- **Action:** Incorporate peer review feedback, making adjustments to character arcs, plot points, or dialogue as necessary.
- **Tools Needed:** Same as STEP 3.
- **Success Criteria:** The script is polished with minimal unresolved issues.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Failing to implement all agreed-upon changes.
- **Time Estimate:** 6 hours.

**STEP 6: [Final Review & Approval]**
- **Action:** Conduct a final review for consistency, readability, and adherence to industry standards. Obtain approval from the director or producer.
- **Tools Needed:** Proofreading tool (e.g., Grammarly), video conferencing platform for remote approvals.
- **Success Criteria:** The script is approved without any unresolved feedback.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing errors due to familiarity with content.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours.

**STEP 7: [Export & Distribution]**
- **Action:** Export the final script in the required format (e.g., PDF) and distribute it through appropriate channels.
- **Tools Needed:** PDF converter, project management tool for tracking distribution status.
- **Success Criteria:** The script is accessible to all relevant parties according to schedule.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Failing to update shared documents after revisions.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour.

### Quality Checkpoints
- **Checkpoint 1:** After STEP 2 - Verify that all feedback categories are correctly mapped to the script sections.

2. Identify top improvement opportunities from collected data.
3. Implement changes such as refining tools or processes.
4. Re-measure to assess impact on script approval rate and turnaround time.
5. Repeat until objectives are consistently met.
