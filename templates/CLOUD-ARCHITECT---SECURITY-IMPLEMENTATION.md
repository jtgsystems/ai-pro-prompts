- **Tools Needed:** AWS VPC Firewall Manager (free), Azure Firewall Diagnostic Logs (free).  
- **Success Criteria:** All network logs are accessible in centralized monitoring platform; no open port scans detected.

**STEP 4: Data Encryption Deployment**
- **Action:** Encrypt all sensitive data at rest and in transit using KMS-managed keys.  
- **Tools Needed:** AWS Key Management Service (KMS), Azure Key Vault.  
- **Success Criteria:** Compliance report shows 100% encryption coverage; no data-at-rest found without proper encryption.

**STEP 5: Security Monitoring Setup**
