### 2. Execution Steps

1. **Define Research Goals**
   - Align research objectives with user needs and business outcomes.
   - Example: "Understand how new users interact with the dashboard to improve onboarding conversion."

2. **Select Research Methods**
   - Choose between qualitative (interviews, usability testing) or quantitative methods (surveys, analytics).
   - Recommended Tools: Google Forms for surveys, Maze for remote usability tests.

3. **Conduct User Interviews**
   - Design interview guides and conduct semi-structured interviews.
   - Record sessions using a tool like Otter.ai for transcriptions.

4. **Create Personas & Scenarios**
   - Synthesize data from research to build user personas and scenarios.
   - Use tools like Miro or Lucidchart for collaborative persona creation.

5. **Develop Prototypes**
   - Create low-fidelity prototypes based on initial findings.
   - Iterate with high-fidelity mockups once concepts are validated.

6. **Run Usability Tests**
   - Test the prototype with real users to validate design decisions.
   - Use Maze or UserTesting.com for remote testing sessions.

7. **Gather and Analyze Data**
   - Collect quantitative data from analytics tools (Google Analytics, Hotjar).
   - Process qualitative data through thematic analysis in NVivo or ATLAS.ti.

8. **Synthesize Findings**
   - Combine insights from interviews, usability tests, and analytics.
   - Document design rationale for each user journey and interaction.

9. **Iterate Design**
   - Refine the design based on testing feedback and new data collection rounds.
   - Use Figma or Adobe XD to update prototypes iteratively.

10. **Report Findings & Recommendations**
    - Prepare a comprehensive report including methodology, findings, recommendations for stakeholders.
    - Present insights using visual aids like charts from Google Data Studio (free) or Tableau Public (free version).

### 4. Success Criteria

1. **Completion Rate**: Measure the percentage of users completing key tasks in usability testing.
2. **Time on Task**: Average time spent by users to complete specific actions, indicating ease of use.
3. **Error Rate**: Frequency of errors or frustration points identified during testing sessions.
4. **Task Success Rate**: Percentage of users successfully completing intended tasks post-revisions.
5. **User Satisfaction**: User ratings and feedback scores from surveys/interviews post-testing phase.

### 5. Troubleshooting

- **High Dropout Rates in Testing**
  - Users may leave due to unclear instructions or unexpected requirements.
  - Solution: Review user stories and task flows, ensure clarity and relevance.

- **Limited Participant Pool**
  - Difficulty reaching a diverse set of users for testing sessions.
  - Solution: Leverage platforms like UserTesting.com with pre-vetted participants.

- **Inconsistent Results Across Tests**
  - Variability in user behavior or preferences leading to contradictory findings.
  - Solution: Increase sample size and diversity, use statistical significance analysis tools (e.g., Google Optimize for A/B testing).
