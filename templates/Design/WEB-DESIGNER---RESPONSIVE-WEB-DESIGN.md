   - Compress images using tools like ImageOptim or Kraken.io

8. **Testing and Debugging**
   - Perform thorough testing of the entire website across various devices, browsers, and network conditions
   - Use browser developer tools to debug CSS and JavaScript issues
   - Conduct performance audits using Lighthouse or WebPageTest

9. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize page load times by minimizing HTTP requests, reducing file sizes, and leveraging caching techniques
   - Implement lazy loading for images and videos that are below the fold
   - Use Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to serve static assets from optimized locations

10. **Deployment and Continuous Integration**
    - Set up a version control system like Git to manage code changes collaboratively
    - Configure automated build processes using tools like Webpack or Gulp
    - Deploy the website to a content management system (CMS) or hosting platform like Netlify or Vercel

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Layout Breakpoints**
   - Ensure proper use of media queries for different breakpoints
   - Test responsiveness in both landscape and portrait orientations

2. **Overflowing Content**
   - Identify elements that overflow their containers on smaller screens
   - Implement overflow handling techniques like scroll areas or hiding content

3. **Text Readability Issues**
   - Check font sizes, line heights, and letter spacing on various devices
   - Ensure text remains legible across different screen resolutions

4. **Fixed-Position Elements**
   - Test fixed-position elements (e.g., navigation menus) for proper behavior on scroll
   - Use JavaScript or CSS to handle edge cases like overflow or z-index conflicts

5. **Performance Degradation**
   - Monitor page load times and identify slow-loading resources
   - Optimize images, minify code, and leverage caching mechanisms

6. **Cross-Browser Rendering Issues**
   - Identify browser-specific rendering bugs or inconsistencies
   - Use feature detection libraries like Modernizr to handle polyfills or fallbacks
