## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process
**STEP 1: [Foundation Setup]**
- **Action:** Set up tracking for new CTAs using Google Analytics events or other analytics tools.
- **Tools Needed:** Google Analytics, Hotjar (optional), Optimizely (optional).
- **Success Criteria:** Events correctly firing on click actions.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Misconfigured UTM parameters leading to incorrect data.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 2: [Initial Implementation]**
- **Action:** Deploy existing CTAs as control groups and create variations for A/B testing.
- **Tools Needed:** Lighthouse, Webflow (for design), Figma (for UI mockups).
- **Success Criteria:** Variations load correctly on the website without breaking functionality.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Loading errors due to incorrect CSS or JavaScript integration.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 3: [Core Work]**
- **Action:** Implement A/B testing using a tool like VWO or Optimizely. Split traffic between control and variation groups.
- **Tools Needed:** VWO, Optimizely, Google Analytics for tracking.
- **Success Criteria:** Traffic evenly distributed across test variants (80/20 split).
- **Common Pitfalls:** Skewed traffic due to server caching or browser cookies.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days

**STEP 4: [Testing Phase]**
- **Action:** Run tests for at least two weeks, ensuring enough data points for statistical significance.
- **Tools Needed:** Google Analytics for real-time monitoring, VWO/ Optimizely dashboard.
- **Success Criteria:** Minimum sample size of 500 unique visitors per variant (based on current traffic).
- **Common Pitfalls:** Insufficient data leading to premature conclusions.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 5: [Analysis Phase]**
- **Action:** Analyze results using statistical significance tools. Compare CTR and conversion rates between control and variations.
- **Tools Needed:** Statistical calculators, A/B testing software reports.
- **Success Criteria:** Variations show at least a 1% increase in CTR compared to the control group.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Misinterpreting p-values or ignoring statistical significance.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 6: [Optimization Phase]**
- **Action:** Based on results, implement winning variations as permanent changes. Roll back non-performing variants.
- **Tools Needed:** CMS (e.g., WordPress), version control system.
- **Success Criteria:** New CTAs integrated without errors; rollback plan in place if needed.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-optimizing based on a single data point or ignoring usability issues.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 7: [Monitoring Phase]**
- **Action:** Monitor post-implementation performance to ensure sustained gains. Set up alerts for any anomalies.
- **Tools Needed:** Google Analytics, UTM parameters.
- **Success Criteria:** CTR remains at or above the target increase after implementation.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring gradual declines in performance over time.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing
