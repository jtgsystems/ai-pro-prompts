### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Issue 1: Continuous Integration Fails Due to Security Checks**
- **Root Cause:** Missing dependencies, unpatched vulnerabilities in IaC templates, or CI pipeline misconfiguration.
- **Solution:** Update IaC with latest security patches; ensure all required modules are installed; check pipeline configuration for proper secret management integration.

**Issue 2: Monitoring Alerts Flood the Team with False Positives**
- **Root Cause:** Misconfigured thresholds in monitoring tools leading to unnecessary alerts.
- **Solution:** Review and adjust alert thresholds based on historical data; implement alert grouping and suppression rules.

**Issue 3: Compliance Policy Violations Persist**
- **Root Cause:** Lack of enforcement mechanisms or inconsistent application across environments.
- **Solution:** Integrate compliance checks into CI/CD pipelines; enforce policies using automated remediation tools where possible.

**Issue 4: Team is Unprepared for Security Incidents**
- **Root Cause:** Inadequate training, outdated playbooks, or unclear roles and responsibilities during a breach.
- **Solution:** Develop comprehensive incident response plans; conduct regular tabletop exercises; establish clear communication channels.

**Issue 5: Supply Chain Dependencies Pose Risks**
- **Root Cause:** Third-party libraries with known vulnerabilities or lack of active maintenance.
- **Solution:** Regularly audit dependencies using automated tools; limit the use of unmanaged third-party code; prefer open-source projects with active community support.
