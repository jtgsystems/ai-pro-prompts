- **Tools Needed:** Excel/Google Sheets, Python pandas library, Amazon API integration tools
- **Success Criteria:** All SKUs categorized correctly with valid inventory counts and sales velocity data
- **Common Pitfalls:** Data mapping errors leading to incorrect category assignments
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 2: [Forecasting Model Setup]**
- **Action:** Implement a Seasonal Hierarchical Decomposition for Trend (SHC) model using Python's Prophet library
- **Tools Needed:** Python environment, Amazon SageMaker notebooks, Google Sheets API
- **Success Criteria:** Forecast accuracy of ±10% with >95% confidence intervals across top 20 SKUs
- **Common Pitfalls:** Data leakage from future periods into training data
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours

**STEP 3: [Reorder Point Configuration]**
- **Action:** Calculate reorder points using Lead Time Demand formula:
  - ROP = (Average Daily Sales * Lead Time in Days) + Safety Stock
- **Tools Needed:** Excel formulas, Inventory Management Software API
- **Success Criteria:** No SKU with stock below Reorder Point threshold for more than 24 hours
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect lead time assumptions leading to overstocking or understocking
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 4: [Automation Workflow Creation]**
- **Action:** Set up automated replenishment workflows using Zapier:
  - When inventory < Reorder Point, create Amazon FBA order in Seller Central
- **Tools Needed:** Zapier account, API keys for Amazon FBA integration
- **Success Criteria:** Successful creation of at least one re-order per week without manual intervention
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect API authentication leading to failed transactions
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours

**STEP 5: [Safety Stock Optimization]**
- **Action:** Implement Safety Stock based on Service Level targets:
  - Safety Stock = Z-score * σ * √LT
  - Where Z-score = 95% confidence level, σ = standard deviation of demand, LT = lead time
- **Tools Needed:** Excel statistical functions, Inventory Management Software
- **Success Criteria:** Holding cost reduced by $200/month while maintaining 99.5% fill rate
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overestimating service levels leading to excessive safety stock
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours

**STEP 6: [Sales Velocity Analysis]**
- **Action:** Analyze top-selling SKUs and adjust reorder quantities based on:
  - Historical sales trends, Seasonal patterns, Competitive analysis
- **Tools Needed:** Amazon Analytics Dashboard, Google Data Studio visualizations
- **Success Criteria:** Top 10% of SKUs contribute to 50% of revenue with inventory turnover > 12 times per year
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring slow-moving items leading to obsolescence
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing weekly review

**STEP 7: [Supplier Performance Tracking]**
- **Action:** Monitor supplier performance metrics:
  - Lead Time, Delivery Accuracy, Quality Defect Rate
- **Tools Needed:** CSV import into Inventory Management System, KPI tracking dashboard
- **Success Criteria:** Average lead time < 5 days, Defect rate < 1%
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inadequate reporting leading to poor supplier selection
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing monthly review

**STEP 8: [Dynamic Pricing Rule Setup]**
- **Action:** Implement dynamic pricing rules based on competitor analysis:
  - Price down by X% if inventory > 30 units, Price up by Y% if below 10 units
- **Tools Needed:** Competitive Intelligence Software API, Amazon Advertising Control Panel
- **Success Criteria:** Price adjustments made automatically without manual intervention
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overpricing leading to reduced sales volume
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours

3. Implement changes:
   - Adjust reorder points, safety stock levels, pricing rules
4. Re-measure after 30 days to ensure metrics improved
5. Repeat until all primary and secondary goals are met
