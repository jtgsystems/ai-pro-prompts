- **Tools Needed:** Optimizely (paid), VWO (premium alternative).
- **Success Criteria:** Identify winning variations with ≥5% improvement in conversion rates or load times.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not isolating variables properly leading to misleading results.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours

**Step 7: Monitoring & Alerting Setup**
- **Action:** Configure monitoring for page load time, uptime, and error rates using tools like Sentry, New Relic.
- **Tools Needed:** Sentry (free tier), New Relic (premium alternative).
- **Success Criteria:** Immediate alerts on performance degradation >10%, automated rollback in case of issues.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not setting up proper alert thresholds.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours
