### 2. Execution Steps

1. **Analyze Current Performance**: Use tools like Google PageSpeed Insights or Lighthouse to analyze current site speed and identify areas for improvement.
   
2. **Optimize Images**:
   - Resize images to the exact dimensions needed on your site.
   - Compress images using tools like ImageOptim (free) or TinyPNG (optional).
   - Use Shopify's built-in image optimization feature.

3. **Minify CSS, JavaScript, and HTML**:
   - Remove unnecessary whitespace and comments from code files.
   - Use a minification plugin in your theme to automate this process.

4. **Implement Caching**:
   - Enable browser caching for static assets (CSS, JS, images).
   - Implement server-side caching using Redis or Memcached.
   - Consider Shopify's built-in performance features like cache rebuilding and CDN integration.

5. **Optimize Database**:
   - Regularly clear out abandoned carts, logs, and other unnecessary data.
   - Use database optimization tools in your hosting environment (e.g., MySQL optimizer).

6. **Leverage Content Delivery Network (CDN)**:
   - Integrate a CDN like Cloudflare or Akamai to serve static assets from locations closer to the user.

7. **Implement Lazy Loading**:
   - Enable lazy loading for images and videos on your site.
   - Use Shopify's native support for lazy loading images where possible.

8. **Optimize Third-Party Apps**:
   - Regularly review third-party apps installed in your store.
   - Deactivate or remove any that are not contributing to performance or sales.

9. **Use Efficient Coding Practices**:
   - Write clean, efficient code with a focus on minimizing HTTP requests.
   - Avoid inline styles and scripts where possible; use CSS and JS files instead.

10. **Monitor Performance Regularly**:
    - Set up Google Analytics and other monitoring tools to track performance over time.
    - Use Shopify's built-in analytics for insights into traffic, load times, and user behavior.

### 3. Tools, Software, and Platforms

- **Text Editors**: VS Code (free), Sublime Text (optional)
- **Version Control**: Git with GitHub or Bitbucket
- **Caching & Performance**:
  - Redis/Memcached (for server-side caching)
  - Cloudflare CDN (free tier available)
- **Image Optimization**:
  - ImageOptim (free)
  - TinyPNG (optional, $7/month plan)
- **Performance Testing**: Google PageSpeed Insights, Lighthouse, WebPageTest
- **SEO Tools**: SEMRush (paid alternative), Ahrefs (paid alternative)
- **Hosting**: Shopify Hosting Plans or third-party hosting with CDN support

### 4. Success Criteria

1. **Load Time Improvement**: Achieve a PageSpeed score of at least 90/100 on both mobile and desktop.
2. **Conversion Rate Increase**: Measure the impact of performance improvements on conversion rates, aiming for a 5-10% increase.
3. **Reduced Bounce Rate**: Decrease bounce rate by implementing faster load times and engaging content.
4. **Search Engine Rankings**: Improve search engine rankings for key products and pages.

### 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Slow Page Load Times**:
  - Check image sizes and optimize them.
  - Ensure caching is enabled at both server and browser level.
  
- **Performance Degradation After Theme Update**:
  - Review the changes made in the theme code.
  - Reapply performance optimizations after updates.

- **High Server Response Time**:
  - Analyze database queries for efficiency.
  - Consider upgrading hosting plans or integrating a CDN.

### 6. Recommended Tool Stack
