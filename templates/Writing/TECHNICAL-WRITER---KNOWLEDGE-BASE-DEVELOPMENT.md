### 2. Execution Steps

1. **Define Scope**: Identify the products, services, or systems that require documentation.
   - Action: Hold a kickoff meeting with stakeholders to gather requirements.

2. **Research Requirements**: Collect specifications, user stories, and any existing documentation.
   - Action: Use tools like Confluence (free) or Notion (optional premium) for gathering input.

3. **Create Outline Structure**:
   - Action: Develop a hierarchical outline using Markdown in VS Code (free).

4. **Draft Content**:
   - Action: Write content in Markdown, ensuring clarity and conciseness.
   - Tool Recommendation: VS Code (free)

5. **Review and Edit**:
   - Action: Use Git for version control to track changes and collaborate with team members.

6. **Proofread and Format**:
   - Action: Convert Markdown to HTML or PDF using tools like Pandoc (free).

7. **Accessibility Check**:
   - Action: Ensure documents meet WCAG guidelines.
   - Tool Recommendation: Axe Core (free) for accessibility testing.

8. **Stakeholder Review**: Share drafts with stakeholders and incorporate feedback.
   - Action: Use Confluence or Notion for collaborative reviews.

9. **Publish**: Deploy the documentation to a web server or document management system.
   - Tool Recommendation: GitHub Pages (free) for hosting static sites.

10. **Update Regularly**: Maintain content by updating it as products evolve.
    - Action: Set up automated notifications in Git for new commits.

### 3. Tools, Software, and Platforms

- **Text Editor**: VS Code (free)
- **Documentation Platform**: Confluence (free), Notion (optional premium)
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Project Management**: Trello (free) or Asana (optional premium)
- **Accessibility Testing**: Axe Core (free)
- **Collaboration**: Slack (free) or Teams (optional premium)
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (free)

### 4. Success Criteria

1. **Completion Rate**: All required documentation is completed within the timeline.
2. **User Satisfaction**: High user ratings for usability and clarity in the documentation portal.
3. **Version Control Stability**: Minimal merge conflicts during collaborative editing phases.
4. **Accessibility Compliance**: Documents pass WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility tests.
5. **Stakeholder Feedback**: Positive feedback from stakeholders on content accuracy and usefulness.

### 5. Troubleshooting

- **Writing Challenges**:
  - If struggling with jargon, consult a glossary or use tools like JargonDetector (free).
  - For unclear instructions, break down the process into smaller steps and test each one.

- **Technical Issues**:
  - Git conflicts: Use merge resolution strategies and communicate changes.
  - Accessibility issues detected: Fix any violations flagged by Axe Core before final publishing.

### 6. Recommended Tool Stack

- **Primary Tools (Free/Open-source)**:
  - VS Code
  - Confluence
  - GitHub/GitLab for version control
  - Markdown editor extensions (e.g., Prettier)
