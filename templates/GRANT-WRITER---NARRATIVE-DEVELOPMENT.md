## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: [Outline Development]**
- **Action:** Draft a detailed outline for the narrative based on stakeholder analysis and funder priorities.  
- **Tools Needed:** Google Docs, Notion, or any collaborative document platform.  
- **Success Criteria:** Outline covers all required sections (Problem Statement, Solutions, Impact, Budget).  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking specific funder keywords; missing key narrative sections.  
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours.

**STEP 2: [Drafting the Narrative]**
- **Action:** Write initial drafts for each section using the outline as a guide.  
- **Tools Needed:** Hemingway App (free), Grammarly (free version), and word processing software like LibreOffice Writer.  
- **Success Criteria:** Draft meets clarity, conciseness, and relevance standards; aligns with funder's language requirements.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Wordiness, lack of specific examples supporting claims.  
- **Time Estimate:** 8 hours.

**STEP 3: [Data Visualization Integration]**
- **Action:** Incorporate charts, graphs, or infographics to support key data points in the narrative.  
- **Tools Needed:** Canva (free), Google Sheets for creating visuals, and embedding into documents.  
- **Success Criteria:** Visuals are clear, accurately represent data, and enhance understanding of project impact.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inaccurate or misleading visualizations; overwhelming text with too many charts.  
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours.

**STEP 4: [Stakeholder Review Cycle]**
- **Action:** Share drafts with stakeholders for feedback; iterate based on their input.  
- **Tools Needed:** Google Docs comments, SurveyMonkey (free tier) for structured feedback forms.  
- **Success Criteria:** At least 75% of key stakeholder feedback incorporated into the proposal.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring critical feedback due to bias or lack of time.  
- **Time Estimate:** 6 hours.

**STEP 5: [Final Review & Compliance Check]**
- **Action:** Conduct a final review for compliance with funder guidelines and technical standards.  
- **Tools Needed:** Funder-specific style guides, plagiarism checkers (Plagiarism Checker by iThenticate is optional), document proofreading tools like ProWritingAid.  
- **Success Criteria:** All sections meet funders' specific requirements; no grammatical errors or data discrepancies.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missed compliance issues due to rushed final checks.  
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours.

**STEP 6: [Budget Justification & Alignment]**
- **Action:** Develop a detailed budget that aligns with the narrative's impact sections and integrates seamlessly into the proposal document.  
- **Tools Needed:** Excel (free) or Google Sheets for creating financial breakdowns, embedded in Word documents.  
- **Success Criteria:** Budget is realistic, breaks down costs by project phase, and justifies each expense based on narrative sections.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking indirect costs; misalignment of budget with narrative's impact claims.  
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours.

**STEP 7: [Narrative Refinement & AI Integration]**
- **Action:** Use AI tools to refine the narrative for clarity, conciseness, and to generate alternative phrasing based on funder language patterns.  
- **Tools Needed:** Claude Code (for text generation), ChatGPT (free tier) for brainstorming phrases, Grammarly Premium (optional).  
- **Success Criteria:** Narrative is optimized for readability and aligns closely with funders' preferred language; AI-generated sections reviewed and approved.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-reliance on AI without human validation of key messages.  
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours.

**STEP 8: [Final Formatting & Submission Preparation]**
- **Action:** Format the final proposal according to funder guidelines, create PDFs for submission, and organize supporting documents (budget, CV, etc.).  
- **Tools Needed:** LibreOffice Writer, Adobe Acrobat Pro DC (free trial), Dropbox or Google Drive for storage.  
- **Success Criteria:** Final document meets all formatting requirements; all attachments are included in a logically organized folder structure.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing required sections due to miscommunication of guidelines; incomplete documentation of supporting materials.  
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours.

**STEP 9: [Peer Review & Legal Compliance Check]**
- **Action:** Conduct a peer review by another grant writer or consultant familiar with the funder's requirements; ensure legal compliance.  
- **Tools Needed:** Collaboration platforms (Slack, Teams), legal checklists from GrantSpace resources.  
- **Success Criteria:** Peer reviewer confirms all sections meet standards; no legal red flags identified for submission.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Skipping peer review due to time constraints or lack of confidence in reviewers' expertise.  
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours.

**STEP 10: [Submission & Tracking]**
- **Action:** Submit the final proposal through the funder's portal; set up a tracking system for submission status and deadlines for follow-up documentation.  
- **Tools Needed:** Grant management platforms (Grantee, Grantee Pro), email reminders set in Google Calendar.  
- **Success Criteria:** Proposal submitted by deadline; tracking mechanism activated with clear next steps defined.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing the submission deadline; no system to track response or feedback from funder.  
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour.

### Quality Checkpoints

- **Checkpoint 1:** [After Step X] - Verify that narrative sections are coherent and logically structured.
- **Checkpoint 2:** [After Step Y] - Validate that all data presented is accurate, up-to-date, and sourced correctly.
- **Checkpoint 3:** [After Step Z] - Confirm stakeholder feedback has been incorporated and addressed.

## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

### Performance Metrics
Define how to measure success:

1. **Primary Metric:** Grant Approval Rate  
   - Target: Minimum 60% approval rate in peer-reviewed competitions.

2. **Secondary Metrics:**  
   - Proposal Readability Score (based on Hemingway App analysis).  
   - Number of Redlines Applied During Peer Review.  

3. **Long-term Metrics:**  
   - Post-Grant Impact Evaluation Scores.  
   - Renewal Rates for Subsequent Funding Cycles.

### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance against targets.
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities (e.g., readability, data clarity).
3. Implement changes in the next proposal cycle.
4. Re-measure and document outcomes.
5. Repeat until approval rate goal achieved.
