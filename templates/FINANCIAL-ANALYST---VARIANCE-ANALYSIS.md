## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: [Data Preparation]**
- **Action:** Clean, validate, and format historical financial data for analysis.
- **Tools Needed:** Python (Pandas), Excel/Google Sheets, or database management tools like SQL.
- **Success Criteria:** Data is free of errors, all required fields are present, and it's ready for variance calculation.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing values, incorrect formatting, overwriting original data without backup.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 2: [Baseline Variance Analysis]**
- **Action:** Conduct an initial variance analysis to understand current performance gaps.
- **Tools Needed:** Excel/Google Sheets with pivot tables or specialized variance analysis software like Alteryx.
- **Success Criteria:** A report showing key variances and their impact on overall financial health is generated.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Focusing only on absolute dollar differences, ignoring qualitative factors.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 3: [Advanced Analysis Setup]**
- **Action:** Set up an advanced analysis environment using AI/ML tools to predict and categorize variances.
- **Tools Needed:** Python (TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn), RStudio for statistical modeling.
- **Success Criteria:** An algorithm is trained on historical data that can classify new variances as predictable or unexpected.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overfitting models to training data, ignoring seasonal trends.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 weeks

**STEP 4: [Automated Data Pipeline Creation]**
- **Action:** Build an automated pipeline for real-time financial data integration into the analysis workflow.
- **Tools Needed:** Python scripts with API calls (e.g., Alpha Vantage), AWS Lambda, or Google Cloud Functions.
- **Success Criteria:** Automated alerts trigger variance reports based on predefined thresholds.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Data latency issues, unhandled exceptions in code.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 5: [Collaborative Analysis Setup]**
- **Action:** Configure a collaborative workspace where multiple analysts can work on the same variance analysis project simultaneously.
- **Tools Needed:** Google Workspace (Sheets, Docs), Miro for brainstorming, Slack/Teams for communication.
- **Success Criteria:** All team members have access to the latest data and insights in real-time.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inconsistent naming conventions, lack of version control.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 6: [Continuous Monitoring & Reporting]**
- **Action:** Implement a system for regular variance analysis reporting and updates.
- **Tools Needed:** Power BI, Tableau, or custom Python Dash applications with scheduled alerts.
- **Success Criteria:** Monthly reports are generated automatically showing variances compared to the budget and historical performance.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Reports not reviewed regularly, outdated data in final reports.
