### PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW  

**STEP 1: [Strategic Planning]**
- **Action:** Conduct a workshop to define risk mitigation strategy aligning with client goals  
- **Tools Needed:** Miro or Lucidchart for collaboration boards, Google Docs for notes  
- **Success Criteria:** Approved risk framework document and prioritized action items list  

**STEP 2: [Risk Mapping & Prioritization]**
- **Action:** Use threat modeling to map identified risks against potential impact and likelihood  
- **Tools Needed:** STRIDE or PASTA software templates, RiskyProject (free tier)  
- **Success Criteria:** Completed risk matrix with high-risk items flagged  

**STEP 3: [Control Implementation Plan]**
- **Action:** Develop a detailed implementation plan for selected controls based on the risk matrix  
- **Tools Needed:** Trello or Asana for task management, Risk Register template (Excel free)  
- **Success Criteria:** Action plan approved by client stakeholders and resources allocated  

**STEP 4: [Control Validation]**
- **Action:** Conduct tabletop exercises to validate effectiveness of implemented controls  
- **Tools Needed:** Tabletop exercise templates from NIST, Teams/Zoom for virtual meetings  
- **Success Criteria:** Exercise report with documented vulnerabilities addressed  

**STEP 5: [Monitoring & Review Setup]**
- **Action:** Establish a monitoring system to track risk mitigation progress and adjust as needed  
- **Tools Needed:** Dashboards in PowerBI (free) or Google Data Studio, KPI tracking sheets  
- **Success Criteria:** Real-time dashboards showing key risk indicators updated quarterly  

**STEP 6: [Training & Awareness Program]**
- **Action:** Design training modules for clients on identified risks and new controls  
- **Tools Needed:** PowerPoint templates, recorded webinars from LinkedIn Learning (free)  
- **Success Criteria:** Training completion rate >90% and post-training assessment scores
