- **Success Criteria:** Successful data sync between inventory and product listings within 24 hours.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect API authentication, missing fields in integration.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 2: [Inventory Data Cleansing]**
- **Action:** Run a bulk update to remove duplicate or obsolete SKUs from the system.
- **Tools Needed:** Excel/Google Sheets for CSV manipulation, Python scripts (pandas).
- **Success Criteria:** 95% reduction in duplicate entries with no loss of data.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overwriting existing stock levels during deduplication.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 3: [Demand Forecasting Model Implementation]**
- **Action:** Deploy a machine learning model to predict future sales based on historical data.
- **Tools Needed:** Python (scikit-learn), AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform, SQL database for storing forecasts.
- **Success Criteria:** Forecast accuracy of +/-10% over the next 3 months' actual sales data.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overfitting to training data, lack of recent trends in model.
- **Time Estimate:** 5 days

**STEP 4: [Optimized Reordering Process Setup]**
- **Action:** Configure automated reordering rules based on forecasted demand and safety stock levels.
- **Tools Needed:** Inventory management software (e.g., TradeGecko), custom scripts for email notifications.
- **Success Criteria:** New orders placed automatically when inventory reaches 10% of safety stock level.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect threshold settings leading to excess or insufficient reorders.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 5: [Return Process Optimization]**
- **Action:** Implement a workflow for processing returns, updating inventory, and generating credit memos.
- **Tools Needed:** E-commerce platform (e.g., Shopify), dedicated return management app (e.g., Returnify).
- **Success Criteria:** Returns processed within 24 hours, inventory updated accurately post-return.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Delay in refund issuance leading to customer dissatisfaction.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 6: [Safety Stock Calculation and Allocation]**
- **Action:** Calculate optimal safety stock levels using the (z-score * standard deviation) formula for each SKU.
- **Tools Needed:** Excel, Python scripts (numpy), inventory management software dashboard.
- **Success Criteria:** Safety stock maintained at recommended levels without causing stockouts.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inaccurate calculation leading to overstock or out-of-stock scenarios.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 7: [Third-Party Logistics Integration]**
- **Action:** Set up API connections between inventory system and chosen 3PL provider for order processing and warehouse management.
- **Tools Needed:** 3PL's logistics software, Zapier or custom integration scripts (Python/Node.js).
- **Success Criteria:** Orders automatically forwarded to 3PL when stock is depleted; real-time tracking available.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Delays in API updates causing mismatched order statuses.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 8: [Inventory Accuracy Audit]**
- **Action:** Conduct a manual audit of physical inventory vs. system inventory for top 20 SKUs.
- **Tools Needed:** Inventory checklist, barcode scanner, spreadsheet for comparison.
- **Success Criteria:** <5% discrepancy between physical and system counts across all items.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Human error in counting or incorrect stock updates.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 9: [Scalability Testing]**
- **Action:** Simulate a spike in sales volume (e.g., Black Friday) to test system performance under load.
- **Tools Needed:** Load testing software (JMeter), monitoring tools (Datadog).
- **Success Criteria:** System maintains <99.5% uptime and processes all orders within SLA during peak traffic.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Database bottlenecks, API timeouts causing order delays.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 10: [Compliance Review]**
