   - Tools Needed: SDL Trados Studio, memoQ, or similar.
   - Success Criteria: Project correctly set up with language pairs and terminology files.
   - Common Pitfalls: Incorrect language pair setup leading to errors.
   - Time Estimate: 30 minutes.

**STEP 2: [Initial Translation]**
- **Action:** Begin translating text using TM and existing glossary.
   - Tools Needed: CAT tool, TermBlox or SDL Terminology.
   - Success Criteria: Initial draft completed with high TM match (>90%).
   - Common Pitfalls: Over-reliance on MT without post-editing leading to errors.
   - Time Estimate: 2-4 hours per document.

**STEP 3: [Quality Assurance]**
- **Action:** Run QA checks using CAT tool's built-in features or external plugins.
   - Tools Needed: CAT tool QA module, ProZ Quality Assurance plugin.
   - Success Criteria: Document passes all QA checks with zero critical errors.
   - Common Pitfalls: Skipping QA leading to missed errors in final delivery.
   - Time Estimate: 30 minutes per document.

**STEP 4: [Peer Review]**
- **Action:** Share draft for peer review by a colleague or mentor.
   - Tools Needed: Google Docs, MS Teams, or email.
   - Success Criteria: Feedback incorporated; document passes all QA checks again.
   - Common Pitfalls: Not incorporating feedback leading to rework.
   - Time Estimate: 1-2 hours.

**STEP 5: [Final Editing]**
- **Action:** Perform final proofreading and formatting adjustments.
   - Tools Needed: Grammarly, ProWritingAid, or similar.
   - Success Criteria: Final document meets client specifications and quality standards.
   - Common Pitfalls: Missing minor formatting errors in the final stage.
   - Time Estimate: 30 minutes per document.

**STEP 6: [Delivery and Feedback Loop]**
- **Action:** Deliver final translation to client, follow up for feedback.
   - Tools Needed: Email, project management tools (Asana, Trello).
   - Success Criteria: Client provides positive feedback; no critical issues reported.
   - Common Pitfalls: No follow-up leading to unresolved issues.
   - Time Estimate: Ongoing.

### Quality Checkpoints
- **Checkpoint 1:** After Step 2 - Verify TM match and glossary usage are correct.
- **Checkpoint 2:** After Step 4 - Ensure all peer review feedback is addressed.
- **Checkpoint 3:** Before Delivery - Confirm final QA checks pass; client signs off.
