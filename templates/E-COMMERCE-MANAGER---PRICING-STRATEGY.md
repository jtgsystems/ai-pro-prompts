## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

### Performance Metrics
Define how to measure success:

1. **Primary Metric:** Monthly Revenue Growth Rate  
   - Target: 12% annual growth  
   - Measurement Method: Compare current month revenue against previous month and year-over-year trends.

2. **Secondary Metrics:**  
   - Average Revenue per User (ARPU): Increase by 5% quarterly  
   - Conversion Rate: Achieve at least 3.5% improvement in checkout completion rates  
   - Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Growth: Target +10% annual increase  

### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance against targets using the dashboard from Phase 3.
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities:
   - Analyze underperforming product segments
   - Test new pricing structures for high-margin items
   - Optimize inventory allocation based on demand forecasts
3. Implement changes through phased rollouts, starting with a single market segment or product category.
4. Re-measure performance after each rollout to ensure targets are met before expanding.
