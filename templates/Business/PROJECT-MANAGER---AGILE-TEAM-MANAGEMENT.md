# Project Manager - AI Agent Template
## Agile Team Management

### 1. Critical Knowledge Areas
- **Agile Principles & Frameworks**: Scrum, Kanban, Lean, Extreme Programming (XP)
- **Project Scope & Requirements**: Defining, gathering, and managing user stories
- **Timeboxing & Sprint Planning**: Estimating tasks, setting sprint goals, monitoring velocity
- **Daily Stand-ups**: Facilitating effective team stand-up meetings
- **Retrospectives**: Conducting meaningful retrospectives to improve processes
- **Backlog Management**: Prioritizing and grooming backlog items
- **Risk Management**: Identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks in agile projects
- **Team Collaboration Tools**: Slack, Teams, Jira, Trello, Asana, Notion
- **Agile Metrics & Reporting**: Burn-down charts, bur-pool (burndown + burnup), velocity tracking
- **Stakeholder Management**: Communicating progress and changes to stakeholders
- **Change Management**: Handling scope changes within agile frameworks
- **Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)**: Automating builds, tests, and deployments
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Writing tests before code in agile development
- **Agile Metrics & KPIs**: Lead time, cycle time, deployment frequency, change failure rate

### 2. Execution Steps
1. **Kickoff Meeting**:
   - Set expectations for the sprint.
   - Define goals and acceptance criteria for user stories.

2. **Sprint Planning**:
   - Review backlog items with stakeholders.
   - Estimate effort using t-shirt sizing or story points.
   - Determine which items will be completed in the current sprint.

3. **Daily Stand-ups**:
   - Facilitate a 15-minute meeting to discuss progress, blockers, and plans for the day.
   - Use tools like Slack or Teams for asynchronous updates if team members can't attend live.

4. **Sprint Execution**:
   - Ensure continuous integration and deployment pipelines are in place.
   - Conduct code reviews using GitHub PRs or GitLab MRs.
   - Monitor progress against the sprint goal.

5. **Mid-Sprint Review (Optional)**:
   - If needed, hold a brief meeting to address blockers or changes mid-sprint.
   - Adjust scope if required while maintaining alignment with goals.

6. **Sprint Demo**:
   - Showcase completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.
   - Document any necessary adjustments for future sprints.

7. **Retrospective Meeting**:
   - Discuss what went well, what didn't, and areas for improvement.
   - Update the team's processes based on findings.

8. **Sprint Retrospective**:
   - Reflect on completed work against the sprint goal.
   - Measure key metrics like velocity, lead time, cycle time, etc.

9. **Post-Sprint Review**:
   - Conduct a thorough review of completed tasks and outcomes.
   - Update backlog items based on feedback and new requirements.

10. **Continuous Improvement**:
    - Implement changes identified during retrospectives.
    - Monitor progress over multiple sprints to ensure continuous improvement.

### 3. Tools & Software
- **Project Management**: Jira (free tier), Trello, Asana, Notion
- **Communication**: Slack (free), Teams (optional)
- **Version Control**: GitHub (free), GitLab (free)
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins (free), CircleCI (optional), GitHub Actions (free)
- **Documentation**: Confluence (free tier), Notion
- **Reporting**: Jira Dashboard, Grafana (free), Tableau (optional)

### 4. Success Criteria
- **Sprint Completion Rate**: Target >80% of planned work completed per sprint.
- **Velocity Consistency**: Maintain a consistent velocity trend over multiple sprints (>90% variance).
- **Lead Time & Cycle Time Reduction**: Reduce lead time and cycle time for each iteration by at least 10%.
- **Defect Rate**: Keep defect rate below 5% of total story points completed.
- **Team Satisfaction**: Achieve >80% satisfaction in post-sprint surveys.

### 5. Troubleshooting
- **Sprint Planning Issues**:
  - Ensure all team members have a clear understanding of user stories.
  - Verify that each item has sufficient acceptance criteria.

- **Daily Stand-ups Not Effective**:
  - Consider using asynchronous stand-up tools for remote or overlapping time zones.
  - Encourage detailed updates in project management software to reduce meeting length.

- **Scope Creep**:
  - Use a change request process to manage scope changes formally.
  - Prioritize new requests based on business value and impact on sprint goals.

- **Performance Bottlenecks**:
  - Identify bottlenecks through CI/CD pipeline analysis.
  - Optimize build times, test coverage, or deployment processes.

### 7. Timeline to Achieve Agile Team Management
- **Weeks 1-2**: Understanding agile principles and frameworks.
- **Weeks 3-4**: Setting up the first sprint with proper planning and tooling.
- **Weeks 5-6**: Executing the first sprint, holding daily stand-ups, retrospectives, and reviews.
- **Weeks 7-8**: Analyzing results, adjusting processes based on feedback.
- **Ongoing**: Iterating on agile practices, incorporating new tools and methodologies as needed.

### 8. Best Practices for 2024-2025
- **Embrace Remote Collaboration**: With the shift towards remote work, ensure that your chosen tools support asynchronous collaboration effectively.
- **Adopt AI/ML for Predictions**: Use AI to predict sprint outcomes based on historical data or automate routine tasks like testing and deployment.
- **Focus on Continuous Learning**: Encourage team members to stay updated with agile practices through online courses or webinars.
- **Implement Gamification**: Introduce elements of gamification in daily stand-ups or retrospectives to boost engagement.
- **Prioritize Security and Compliance**: Ensure that all tools used meet industry standards for data security and privacy.
