- **Tools Needed:** ServiceNow ITSM Suite, Jira Service Management.
- **Success Criteria:** Tickets auto-routed within 30 seconds; no manual misrouting observed.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Misconfigured SLA settings leading to delayed notifications.

**STEP 4: Automate Routine Tasks**

- **Action:** Use Ansible for deploying updates across endpoints; Puppet/Chef for configuration management.
- **Tools Needed:** Ansible, Puppet, Chef.
- **Success Criteria:** All updates deployed within defined window without manual intervention.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Syntax errors in playbooks leading to deployment failures.

**STEP 5: Set Up Cloud Monitoring**

- **Action:** Configure monitoring for AWS or Azure services using CloudWatch/Azure Monitor.
- **Tools Needed:** AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor.
- **Success Criteria:** Alerts generated for CPU throttling, storage issues; dashboards updated in real-time.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect metric thresholds leading to unnecessary alerts.

**STEP 6: Implement Backup Solutions**

- **Action:** Configure daily backups using Veeam/Acronis and schedule regular restores.
- **Tools Needed:** Veeam Backup & Replication, Acronis Cyber Protect.
- **Success Criteria:** Successful backup completion reports; restores completed within defined RTO/RPO.

- **Tools Needed:** SIEM, EDR tools for analysis post-exercise.
- **Success Criteria:** All participants successfully resolve simulated incidents within defined timeframes.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of clear communication channels leading to confusion during drills.

**STEP 8: Set Up Maintenance Alerts**

- **Action:** Configure alerts based on predictive analytics data (e.g., server load, disk usage).
- **Tools Needed:** IBM Maximo, GFI LanGuard.
- **Success Criteria:** Proactive maintenance initiated within defined thresholds; follow-up actions logged.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overly aggressive alerts leading to alert fatigue.

**STEP 9: Monitor and Optimize Performance**

- **Action:** Regularly review metrics such as uptime percentages and ticket resolution times.
- **Tools Needed:** SolarWinds, ServiceNow reports.
- **Success Criteria:** Metrics trend towards meeting targets; deviations addressed promptly.
