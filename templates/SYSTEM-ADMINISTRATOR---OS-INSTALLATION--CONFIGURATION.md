- **Tools Needed:** Ansible playbook, inventory file listing the server host.
- **Success Criteria:** Playbook runs without errors; system reports changes applied successfully.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect syntax in playbooks causing execution failures.
- **Time Estimate:** 20 minutes

**STEP 7: [Testing and Validation]**
- **Action:** Run a suite of tests to ensure the server is operating correctly (e.g., ping, curl, SSH connectivity).
- **Tools Needed:** `ping`, `curl`, `ssh`.
- **Success Criteria:** All test commands return successful results; no error messages.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Misconfigured firewall rules blocking necessary services.
- **Time Estimate:** 15 minutes

**STEP 8: [Backup Configuration]**
- **Action:** Configure initial backup for the server using tools like rsync or Ansible modules.
