## Resolved Technical Issues

### 1. Critical Knowledge Areas

1. Operating Systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
2. Networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, firewalls)
3. Hardware troubleshooting (motherboards, CPUs, RAM, storage devices)
4. Software troubleshooting (OS and application-level issues)
5. Remote access tools (TeamViewer, LogMeIn, VNC)
6. Incident response procedures
7. Documentation and knowledge management systems
8. Problem-solving methodologies (Root Cause Analysis, Pareto Principle)
9. Change Management processes
10. Security best practices (antivirus, firewalls, encryption)
11. Cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)
12. Virtualization platforms (VMware, Hyper-V)
13. Backup and disaster recovery strategies
14. Vendor support channels and SLAs

### 2. Execution Steps

1. **Initial Contact**: Accept the ticket request through your ticketing system (e.g., Jira, ServiceNow) or monitor alerts from monitoring tools (e.g., Nagios, Zabbix).

2. **Gather Information**: Collect essential details about the issue:
   - Description of the problem
   - Date and time it started
   - Affected user(s)
   - System specifications
   - Any recent changes to hardware/software

3. **Remote Access (if required)**: Establish a secure remote connection using your preferred tool (e.g., TeamViewer, LogMeIn) or leverage built-in tools like Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

4. **Identify the Issue**: Narrow down the possible causes based on user input and system logs.

5. **Gather Logs and Diagnostics Data**:
   - Collect relevant log files from the OS, applications, and monitoring systems.
   - Run diagnostic tests to gather additional information.

6. **Apply Known Fixes**: Implement any known solutions or workarounds found in your documentation repository (e.g., Confluence, SharePoint) or vendor-provided guides.

7. **Test Resolution**: Verify if the issue is resolved after applying the fix.

8. **Document the Issue and Solution**: Update the ticket with a clear description of the problem and steps taken to resolve it in your knowledge management system.

9. **Follow Up (if needed)**: If the user still encounters issues, escalate the ticket to higher-level support or schedule an on-site visit if necessary.

10. **Close the Ticket**: Mark the ticket as resolved once the issue is fully addressed and confirmed by the user.

  - Notion (free with premium features available)

- **Incident Response and Collaboration**:
  - Slack (basic version is free)
  - Teams (integrated with Office 365)
  - Google Workspace (Email, Docs, Sheets, Slides)

### 4. Success Criteria

- **Resolution Rate**: Achieve a high resolution rate within the SLA timeframe (e.g., 80% of tickets resolved within 24 hours).
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Maintain an average satisfaction score above 85% in post-ticket surveys.
- **Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)**: Reduce MTTR by at least 20% compared to previous periods, aiming for less than 4 hours.
- **Ticket Reopen Rate**: Keep the ticket reopen rate below 5%.

### 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Windows Operating System Issues
1. **Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)**:
   - Check recent driver updates and hardware changes.
   - Run `chkdsk` to scan for disk errors.

2. **Slow Performance**:
   - Disable startup programs using Task Manager (`msconfig`).
   - Perform a disk cleanup and defragmentation.

#### Application Crashes
1. **Identify the application version causing issues**.
2. **Check for recent software updates or changes**.
3. **Run the application in compatibility mode** (Windows 7/Vista/XP).

#### Network Connectivity Problems
1. **Verify physical connections** (cables, adapters).
2. **Test DNS resolution using `nslookup` and `ping` commands**.
3. **Check for firewall rules blocking traffic**.

#### Remote Access Connection Failures
1. **Confirm user credentials are correct**.
2. **Check remote access client software version compatibility**.
3. **Ensure the target machine is running and reachable**.

### 6. Recommended Tool Stack
