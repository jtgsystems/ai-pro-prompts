   - Identify gaps and take corrective actions
   - Document evidence of compliance for auditing purposes

10. **Report Findings**
    - Prepare a detailed report summarizing audit findings
    - Include executive summary, technical details, and recommendations
    - Present findings to stakeholders and propose action plans

11. **Remediate Issues**
    - Prioritize remediation based on severity and risk
    - Implement fixes in coordination with affected teams
    - Verify that issues are resolved before completing the audit

12. **Conduct Post-Audit Review**
    - Evaluate the effectiveness of the audit process
    - Identify areas for improvement in future audits
    - Update policies, procedures, and controls based on lessons learned

### 4. Measurable Success Criteria for "Security Audit Completion"

- All critical assets have been inventoried and assessed
- No high-severity vulnerabilities remain unaddressed post-audit
- Security policies are up-to-date, comprehensive, and implemented across all systems
- Incident response procedures are tested and validated during the audit
- Compliance with relevant regulations is demonstrated through documented evidence
- Audit report is complete, signed off by stakeholders, and stored securely

### 5. Troubleshooting Section for Common Issues

**Issue: Incomplete Asset Inventory**
- Verify that all discovery tools (e.g., Nmap) are configured correctly
- Ensure network segmentation allows scanning from the audit team's perspective
- Check firewall rules to confirm outbound scans are permitted

**Issue: High Number of Low-Score Vulnerabilities**
- Review false positives and ensure they have been properly triaged
- Investigate why these vulnerabilities were not prioritized for remediation
- Consider if certain tools or techniques missed them during scanning

**Issue: Compliance Gaps**
- Check that policies are correctly implemented in practice
- Verify that configuration items align with the latest CIS benchmarks
- Confirm that audit findings are addressed before reporting closure
