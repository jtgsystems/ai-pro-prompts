## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process with Mobile-Specific Focus

**STEP 1: [Foundation Setup]**
- **Action:** Define project scope, target audience, and core functionalities.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma for design mockups, Trello/Asana for task management.
- **Success Criteria:** Clear project brief approved by stakeholders; UI/UX guidelines aligned with platform standards.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking platform-specific accessibility requirements.
- **Time Estimate:** 5 days

**STEP 2: [Platform-Specific Design Implementation]**
- **Action:** Create responsive layouts using Auto Layout for iOS and ConstraintLayout for Android, ensuring adherence to HIG and MDG.
- **Tools Needed:** Xcode + SwiftUI/UIKit or Android Studio + XML layout files; Figma/Adobe XD for design prototyping.
- **Success Criteria:** Designs pass the 80%+ check against platform-specific guidelines; mockups approved by stakeholders.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not accounting for device fragmentation (different screen sizes, orientations).
- **Time Estimate:** 10 days

**STEP 3: [Core Functionality Development]**
- **Action:** Implement core features using a cross-platform framework if applicable, ensuring platform-specific performance optimizations are applied.
- **Tools Needed:** React Native/Flutter SDKs; Xcode or Android Studio for native modules.
- **Success Criteria:** All critical functionalities work flawlessly in both emulators and physical devices across the target device range.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not optimizing image assets for different resolutions (e.g., 1080x1920 vs 1440x2560).
- **Time Estimate:** 20 days

**STEP 4: [Performance Optimization]**
- **Action:** Profile app performance, identify bottlenecks, and optimize memory usage, network requests, and UI rendering.
- **Tools Needed:** Xcode Instruments (Leaks, Allocations), Android Studio Profiler; Firebase Crashlytics for real-time crash reporting.
- **Success Criteria:** App meets FCP ≤ 2.5s and TTI ≤ 3s on high-end devices; Crash rate < 1% in test flights.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring background task performance issues (e.g., push notifications not handled properly).
- **Time Estimate:** 10 days

**STEP 5: [Testing & Quality Assurance]**
- **Action:** Conduct unit, integration, UI, and automated regression tests across both platforms.
- **Tools Needed:** Jest for JS/TS modules; XCTest/XCUI for native testing; Appium for cross-platform automation.
- **Success Criteria:** All critical bugs fixed in test flight builds; 95%+ code coverage achieved.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not testing locale-specific data handling and permissions flows.
- **Time Estimate:** 10 days

**STEP 6: [Deployment Preparation]**
- **Action:** Prepare app for submission to the App Store and Google Play, ensuring all assets are optimized and metadata is SEO-friendly.
- **Tools Needed:** Fastlane for automated deployment; Google's Mobile-Friendly Test for web pages if applicable.
- **Success Criteria:** Build passes review guidelines on both platforms; Asset optimization reduces bundle size by ≥ 20%.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not including necessary permissions or missing certificates (e.g., Apple Push Notification Service).
- **Time Estimate:** 5 days

**STEP 7: [App Store/Play Submission]**
- **Action:** Submit app to respective stores, respond to reviewer feedback, and monitor post-launch analytics.
- **Tools Needed:** App Store Connect; Google Play Console; Crashlytics/Firebase for real-time monitoring.
- **Success Criteria:** App approved within standard review times (iOS: 5 business days; Android: 7 business days); Post-launch crash rate < 0.5%.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not setting up analytics before submission, leading to delayed insights.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing

**STEP 8: [Post-Launch Optimization]**
- **Action:** Analyze user feedback and analytics data, prioritize fixes/improvements based on impact and effort.
- **Tools Needed:** Google Analytics for Android; Firebase Crashlytics/Analytics for iOS; User Reviews from App Store and Play Store.
- **Success Criteria:** Monthly crash rate < 0.5%; Net Promoter Score (NPS) improves by ≥ 10 points within 3 months.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring negative reviews or feedback loops in the update process.
- **Time Estimate:** Continuous
