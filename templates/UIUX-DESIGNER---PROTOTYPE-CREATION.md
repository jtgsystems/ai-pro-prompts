## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: [Foundation Setup]**
- **Action:** Define project scope, objectives, and deliverables.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma, Miro (or similar whiteboard tool), Trello or Asana for task management.
- **Success Criteria:** Clear brief documented with stakeholder approval.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ambiguous requirements leading to rework.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days.

**STEP 2: [Research and Ideation]**
- **Action:** Conduct user research (surveys, interviews) and gather inspiration from competitors or design trends.
- **Tools Needed:** Google Forms for surveys, Pinterest for trend research, Figma's library of assets.
- **Success Criteria:** A collection of insights and mood boards reflecting target audience needs.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of diverse user input leading to a narrow solution.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days.

**STEP 3: [Wireframing]**
- **Action:** Create low-fidelity wireframes based on the initial research.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch for prototyping.
- **Success Criteria:** Wireframes reviewed and approved by stakeholders.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overcomplicating early stages leading to delays later.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 days.

**STEP 4: [High-Fidelity Prototyping]**
- **Action:** Develop interactive prototypes with clickable elements and animations.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma, Adobe XD for prototyping; Lottie files for animations if needed.
- **Success Criteria:** Interactive prototype tested on devices simulating target audience usage environments.
- **Common Pitfalls:** High-fidelity prototypes failing to render correctly across different devices or browsers.
- **Time Estimate:** 5 days.

**STEP 5: [Usability Testing]**
- **Action:** Conduct usability tests with real users, gather feedback, and iterate on design.
- **Tools Needed:** UserTesting.com, Lookback.io for recording sessions; Google Forms for feedback collection.
- **Success Criteria:** Identified pain points addressed in subsequent iterations.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not involving enough diverse user groups leading to skewed results.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days.

**STEP 6: [Final Review and Polish]**
- **Action:** Final review of the prototype with stakeholders, refine interactions, and prepare for presentation or handoff.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma, InVision Studio for final adjustments; Adobe Acrobat for documentation export.
- **Success Criteria:** Stakeholder approval received, all assets prepared for delivery.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Last-minute changes leading to missed deadlines.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day.

**STEP 7: [Documentation and Handoff]**
- **Action:** Document design decisions, user flows, and accessibility considerations; prepare handoff package for developers.
- **Tools Needed:** Confluence or Notion for documentation; Zeplin or Figma plugin for exporting specs.
- **Success Criteria:** Comprehensive handoff package delivered on time.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incomplete or missing assets leading to delays in development.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day.

### Quality Checkpoints
Insert checkpoints between major steps:
- **Checkpoint 1:** After Step X - Verify all initial requirements are documented and approved.
- **Checkpoint 2:** After Step Y - Validate that user research insights align with the project goals.
- **Checkpoint 3:** After Step Z - Ensure prototypes function correctly across target devices.

## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

### Performance Metrics
Define how to measure success:

1. **Primary Metric:** Usability score from user testing (target > 80% satisfaction).
2. **Secondary Metrics:**
   - Time to task completion.
   - Number of errors reported by users.
3. **Long-term Metrics:**
   - Post-launch bug reports.
   - User retention rates.

### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance against targets.
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities (e.g., navigation issues, accessibility gaps).
3. Implement changes in the next prototype iteration.
4. Re-measure and validate improvements.
5. Repeat until all metrics are met.
