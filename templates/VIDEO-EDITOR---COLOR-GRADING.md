- **Action**: Load source clips into project timeline, label appropriately (e.g., "Reference Warm", "Reference Cool").
   - Tools Needed: Project file in Premiere Pro or Resolve.
   - Success Criteria: All reference files imported and visible on timeline.
   - Common Pitfalls: Incorrect file paths; Files not recognized as video.
   - Time Estimate: 30 minutes

**STEP 3: Establish Baseline Grading**
- **Action**: Apply initial color adjustments using default settings, then refine based on reference material.
   - Tools Needed: Color Mixer tool in Premiere Pro or Color Wheels/ Curves in Resolve.
   - Success Criteria: Initial grading reflects mood/emotion from reference clips.
   - Common Pitfalls: Over-correction; Missing key frames for dynamic scenes.
   - Time Estimate: 2 hours

**STEP 4: Apply LUTs & Grading Profiles**
- **Action**: Use Look Up Tables (LUTs) and predefined grading profiles to achieve project-specific look.
   - Tools Needed: Color Checker app, third-party LUT libraries.
   - Success Criteria: Consistent color grading across clips; No noticeable color shifts.
   - Common Pitfalls: Using incompatible LUT format; Incorrect profile application.
   - Time Estimate: 2 hours

**STEP 5: Detail Adjustments**
- **Action**: Refine shadows, midtones, and highlights using targeted adjustments for specific scenes.
   - Tools Needed: Masks/Keyframes in Premiere Pro or Color Wheels/Curves in Resolve.
   - Success Criteria: Scene-specific colors corrected; Overall image balanced.
   - Common Pitfalls: Over-shadows/highlights; Inconsistent exposure across shots.
   - Time Estimate: 3 hours

**STEP 6: Apply Grain & Texture**
- **Action**: Add grain or texture to enhance cinematic look, especially for archival footage.
   - Tools Needed: Grain generator in Premiere Pro; Texture overlays in Resolve.
   - Success Criteria: Natural-looking grain without overpowering the image.
   - Common Pitfalls: Too much grain; Clashing textures with color grading.
   - Time Estimate: 30 minutes

**STEP 7: Review Across Platforms**
- **Action**: Render and review final clips on target platforms (YouTube, Vimeo) to ensure visual consistency.
   - Tools Needed: Export settings in Premiere Pro or Resolve; Platform-specific player tools.
