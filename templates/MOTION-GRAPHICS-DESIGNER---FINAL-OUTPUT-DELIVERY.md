- Action: Apply color grades using established LUTs and custom adjustments
- Tools Needed:
  - DaVinci Resolve for professional color grading
  - After Effects with Essential Graphics Panel for quick tweaks
- Success Criteria: Consistent look across all shots with final LUT applied
- Common Pitfalls: Overly saturated colors or inconsistent brightness levels
- Time Estimate: 2 hours

**STEP 8: [Review & Revision Loop]**
- Action: Conduct internal reviews, gather client feedback, make revisions
- Tools Needed:
  - Google Drive or Dropbox for shared review links
  - Adobe Acrobat for gathering comments and making changes

### Troubleshooting Section

**Common Issues & Solutions**

| Issue | Symptoms | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Audio Out of Sync | Visual and audio not aligned | Re-render audio in Adobe Audition, then re-import into After Effects |
| High File Size | Export times long or files too large for upload | Optimize layers with PNG sequence instead of Photoshop PSDs; use ProRes 4:2:0 codec for rendering |
| Color Shifts Between Platforms | Colors look different on other devices | Use Adobe RGB color space in Illustrator and export as CMYK if needed for print |
| Asset Missing Errors | Rendering fails due to missing files | Verify all assets are properly named and stored in centralized library; check project import settings |
| Frame Rate Issues | Video appears stuttering or jerky | Ensure consistent frame rate throughout (e.g., 24fps) and use After Effects' Optimize Media feature |
