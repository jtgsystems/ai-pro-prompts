**STEP 6: [Create Assessments]**
- **Action:** Design formative and summative assessments that measure mastery of objectives.
- **Tools Needed:** Rubric creation tools (e.g., Google Sheets, rubistar.org).
- **Success Criteria:** Each assessment is linked to a learning objective; assessments are aligned with state standards.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Assessments not tied to objectives; overly difficult or biased questions.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days

**STEP 7: [Pilot Test Curriculum]**
- **Action:** Implement the curriculum in a small group of students and gather feedback.
- **Tools Needed:** Survey tools (e.g., Google Forms) for student feedback; analytics dashboards.
- **Success Criteria:** Feedback indicates at least 80% understanding of objectives; no major technical issues reported.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inadequate feedback collection; ignoring negative feedback.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 8: [Revise Based on Feedback]**
- **Action:** Refine activities, assessments, and learning objectives based on student performance and teacher observations.
- **Tools Needed:** Spreadsheet software for tracking changes (e.g., Excel); version control systems.
- **Success Criteria:** All revisions are documented; at least one improvement in engagement or understanding metrics.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking minor issues; not revising enough areas to meet objectives.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 9: [Full Implementation]**
- **Action:** Roll out the fully developed curriculum to all students.
- **Tools Needed:** Learning management system (e.g., Canvas, Google Classroom).
- **Success Criteria:** All units are taught as planned; student engagement and performance meet targets.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inconsistent implementation across sections or classes; lack of support for diverse learners.
