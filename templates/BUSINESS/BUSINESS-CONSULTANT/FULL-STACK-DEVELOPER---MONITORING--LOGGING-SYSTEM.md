- **Tools Needed:** Terraform CLI, AWS Management Console/CLI, kubectl for Kubernetes.
- **Success Criteria:** All resources are provisioned and accessible via SSH/Terminal.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect IAM roles leading to permission errors; misconfigured network settings causing connectivity issues.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours

**STEP 2: [Logging Infrastructure Setup]**
- **Action:** Deploy a centralized logging solution (e.g., ELK Stack) and configure data ingestion pipelines for application logs, system metrics, and container logs.
- **Tools Needed:** Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana; Docker/Kubernetes for log aggregation.
- **Success Criteria:** Logs are ingested into the ELK stack within 5 minutes of generation.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect index patterns causing data loss; network firewalls blocking access to the logging service.
- **Time Estimate:** 6 hours

**STEP 3: [Monitoring Infrastructure Setup]**
- **Action:** Configure APM tools (e.g., Datadog, New Relic) to monitor application performance metrics such as response times, error rates, and resource utilization.
- **Tools Needed:** Datadog Agent, Prometheus exporters for Node.js/React applications.
- **Success Criteria:** Real-time dashboards displaying key metrics with alerts configured for critical thresholds.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing configuration files leading to incomplete monitoring; alert fatigue due to excessive notifications.
- **Time Estimate:** 8 hours

**STEP 4: [Real-Time Alerting Setup]**
- **Action:** Define alert rules in the chosen APM tool based on SLOs (Service Level Objectives) and set up notification channels via Slack, email, or PagerDuty.
- **Tools Needed:** Datadog/Prometheus alerts; Slack/Email integrations.
- **Success Criteria:** Alerts trigger correctly during simulated load tests without false positives.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Insufficient test coverage leading to undetected alerting issues.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours

**STEP 5: [Container Monitoring Integration]**
- **Action:** Integrate container monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus Operator, cAdvisor) with the logging solution for Kubernetes environments.
- **Tools Needed:** Helm charts for Prometheus; Grafana dashboards.
- **Success Criteria:** Metrics from containers are displayed in Grafana and accessible via alerts.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Misconfigured metrics leading to incomplete data sets.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours

**STEP 6: [Security Monitoring Configuration]**
- **Action:** Set up log analysis for security events (e.g., failed login attempts, unusual access patterns) using OSSEC or Splunk with SIEM integration.
- **Tools Needed:** OSSEC agents on servers; Splunk forwarder for centralized log analysis.
- **Success Criteria:** Security alerts are generated and logged in real-time.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of rule definitions leading to missed security events.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours

**STEP 7: [Performance Benchmarking]**
- **Action:** Establish baseline performance metrics using synthetic monitoring tools (e.g., Pingdom, UTM).
- **Tools Needed:** Synthetic monitoring scripts; Load testing tools like k6 or JMeter.

- **Action:** Define log retention policies based on regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and set up automated rotation scripts.
- **Tools Needed:** Logrotate; Compliance checklists.
- **Success Criteria:** Logs are rotated daily without overwriting data that is needed for compliance purposes.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect file permissions leading to inaccessible logs during rotation.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 9: [Cross-Environment Monitoring Validation]**
- **Action:** Test the monitoring setup across all environments (development, staging, production) and verify consistent data collection.
- **Tools Needed:** Synthetic monitors; Grafana dashboards for different environments.
- **Success Criteria:** All environments show identical performance metrics and alerting configurations.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Environment-specific configuration files causing discrepancies in log ingestion or metric availability.
