  - Final file length meets editorial guidelines (e.g., under 30 mins)

- **Common Pitfalls:**  
  - Overzealous noise reduction leading to loss of voice details
  - Incorrect segment splitting causing out-of-order playback
  - Failing to save backup copies before final export

- **Time Estimate:**  
  - Editing and cleanup: 1.5x session time  

**STEP 4: [Mixing & Mastering]**
- **Action:** 
  - Balance dialogue vs. music/bgm elements
  - Apply equalization for clarity (e.g., 6 dB boost at 3kHz)
  - Add subtle reverb to create a cohesive ambiance
  - Render final master file in desired format (44.1kHz, 16-bit WAV/MP3)

- **Tools Needed:**  
  - Reaper/Audacity Mastering Chain
  - iZotope Ozone for mastering plug-ins
  - Audacity's built-in EQ and compression

- **Success Criteria:**  
  - Audio passes loudness normalization test (e.g., PPM -1.0)
  - Consistent volume throughout episode
  - No artifacts or glitches during playback

- **Common Pitfalls:**  
  - Over-compression causing punchy audio
  - Incorrect reverb timing resulting in artificial echo
  - Failing to maintain original sample rate/format integrity

- **Time Estimate:**  
  - Mastering: ~30 mins  

**STEP 5: [Distribution & Promotion]**
- **Action:** 
  - Upload final file to hosting platform (e.g., Libsyn, SoundCloud)
  - Create metadata (episode title, description, tags)
  - Promote episode on social media and newsletter
  - Schedule release according to editorial calendar

- **Tools Needed:**  
  - Apple Podcasts Connect or Google Play Music Manager
  - RSS feed for automated distribution
  - Buffer/ Hootsuite for social scheduling

- **Success Criteria:**  
  - Episode appears live on all platforms within designated timeframe
  - Metadata accurately reflects content and SEO keywords
  - Social media promotions drive pre-listening traffic (e.g., >100 clicks)

- **Common Pitfalls:**  
  - Incorrect metadata causing indexing issues
  - Overly broad or misspelled tags reducing discoverability
  - Failed upload due to platform downtime

- **Time Estimate:**  
  - Upload and promotion: <30 mins  

**STEP 6: [Quality Assurance & Feedback Loop]**
- **Action:** 
  - Perform final audio quality check (playback across devices)
  - Conduct listener QA testing with sample audience
  - Gather feedback through surveys or social media
  - Implement changes for next session based on insights

- **Tools Needed:**  
  - VLC Media Player for cross-platform playback tests
