- **Common Pitfalls:** Underestimating stakeholder engagement, incomplete objective definition.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 2: [Content Mapping]**
- **Action:** Create a content map detailing all topics to be covered and their sequencing.
- **Tools Needed:** Miro or Lucidchart for visual mapping; Excel for tabular representation.
- **Success Criteria:** A comprehensive, logically sequenced content flow that aligns with learning objectives.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inconsistent terminology across modules, missing prerequisite information.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 3: [Storyboarding & Scriptwriting]**
- **Action:** Develop storyboards for each module and write detailed scripts.
- **Tools Needed:** Adobe Captivate or Articulate Storyline for e-learning prototypes; Google Docs for writing.
- **Success Criteria:** Clear, engaging content that aligns with the intended learning outcomes.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Vague instructions, lack of engagement elements (e.g., quizzes).
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 4: [Prototyping]**
- **Action:** Build interactive prototypes using tools like Articulate Storyline or Adobe Captivate.
- **Tools Needed:** Articulate Storyline, Adobe Captivate, Google Slides for initial mockups.
- **Success Criteria:** Interactive prototype that simulates the final e-learning experience.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-reliance on static content without interactive elements.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 weeks

**STEP 5: [Design Review & Iteration]**
- **Action:** Conduct usability testing with a small group of learners or subject matter experts.
- **Tools Needed:** UserTesting.com, UsabilityHub for remote testing; Miro for feedback sessions.
- **Success Criteria:** High usability score (≥80/100) and actionable feedback incorporated.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring critical feedback, failing to iterate based on test results.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 6: [Development & Integration]**
- **Action:** Develop the final e-learning modules using chosen tools and integrate into LMS.
- **Tools Needed:** Articulate Rise, Adobe Captivate Publish; Canvas or Moodle for LMS integration.
- **Success Criteria:** All content published to LMS with correct access permissions and tracking enabled.
