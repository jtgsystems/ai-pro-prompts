## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: [Segmentation Setup]**
```yaml
- **Action:** Define audience segments using platform's built-in tools.
- **Tools Needed:** ESP (Mailchimp), CRM integration for historical data.
- **Success Criteria:** Segments are mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive (MECE).
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlapping segments or missing high-value audiences.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours
```

**STEP 2: [Subject Line A/B Testing Prep]**
```yaml
- **Action:** Create two subject line variations for each segment.
- **Tools Needed:** ESP A/B testing feature, copywriting guidelines.
- **Success Criteria:** Each variation is unique and aligned with campaign objective.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Repetitive language or violating brand voice standards.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours
```

**STEP 3: [Content Personalization Setup]**
```yaml
- **Action:** Develop personalized content blocks for each segment.
- **Tools Needed:** ESP merge tags, dynamic content builder.
- **Success Criteria:** Content is relevant to recipient's past interactions and preferences.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Hardcoding data points that may not be available in all segments.
- **Time Estimate:** 6 hours
```

**STEP 4: [Send Time Testing Preparation]**
```yaml
- **Action:** Identify optimal send times based on historical open rates for each segment.
- **Tools Needed:** ESP analytics dashboard, third-party tools like Litmus or EmailAnalytics.
- **Success Criteria:** Send time is aligned with peak engagement periods identified in data.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Relying solely on general industry recommendations without data validation.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours
```

**STEP 5: [Targeting Parameter Testing]**
```yaml
- **Action:** Define targeting parameters for each test (e.g., IP address, device type).
- **Tools Needed:** ESP segment filters, third-party audience analysis tools.
- **Success Criteria:** Parameters are mutually exclusive and cover all possible variations.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlapping or missing targeting criteria that could skew results.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours
```

**STEP 6: [A/B Testing Execution]**
```yaml
- **Action:** Deploy A/B tests through ESP, monitor delivery rates, and track metrics in real-time.
- **Tools Needed:** ESP analytics dashboard, third-party monitoring tools (e.g., Google Analytics).
- **Success Criteria:** Tests are completed with sufficient sample size for statistical significance.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Test not running long enough to gather reliable data or invalid traffic affecting results.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing throughout campaign duration
```

**STEP 7: [Analytics and Reporting]**
```yaml
- **Action:** Collect metrics, compare performance of variants, calculate statistical significance.
- **Tools Needed:** ESP analytics dashboard, Google Analytics, statistical calculators (e.g., Evan Miller's).
- **Success Criteria:** Variants that outperform are rolled out to broader audience; results documented.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Misinterpreting p-values or ignoring sample size limitations.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours per test
```

**STEP 8: [Iterative Optimization]**
```yaml
- **Action:** Based on initial A/B test results, refine and retest based on new insights.
- **Tools Needed:** Same as above.
- **Success Criteria:** Each iteration improves key metrics by a pre-defined threshold (e.g., +5% open rate).
- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-optimizing for minor gains or failing to account for external factors affecting results.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing
```

### Quality Checkpoints
```yaml
- Verify that all segments are properly assigned to A/B tests.
- Validate that tracking pixels and links are functioning correctly.
- Confirm that statistical significance is calculated using appropriate methods (e.g., Bayesian analysis).
- Ensure compliance with data protection regulations during testing.
```

## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

### Performance Metrics
```yaml
1. **Primary Metric:** Subject Line Open Rate (+5% from baseline)
   - Target: Achieve at least a 5% improvement in open rates compared to current average.

2. **Secondary Metrics:**
   - Click-Through Rate (CTR): +3%
   - Conversion Rate: +7%
   - Unsubscribe Rate: <0.1%

3. **Long-term Metrics:**
   - ROI from A/B testing process: 20% reduction in unsubscribe rate and 15% increase in sales conversions.
```

### Iterative Improvement Loop
```yaml
1. Measure current performance against targets using ESP analytics dashboard.
2. Identify top 3 areas for improvement (e.g., low open rates, high bounce rates).
3. Implement changes based on research findings (e.g., new subject line variations, targeting adjustments).
4. Re-measure results after test duration to ensure statistical significance.
5. Repeat until all primary and secondary metrics are optimized.
```

## PHASE 5: REPORTING & DOCUMENTATION

### Deliverables
```yaml
1. **Executive Summary**
   - Current state vs. target state for each metric.
   - Key actions taken (e.g., A/B tests implemented).

2. **Detailed Report**
   - Methodology used for segmentation, testing design, and analysis.
   - Full research findings on email platform optimization, subject line best practices, etc.

3. **Maintenance Plan**
   - Ongoing tasks to maintain results (e.g., regular segment refreshes).
   - Monitoring schedule (daily/weekly ESP dashboards).
   - Update frequency for content based on engagement data.

4. **Knowledge Transfer**
