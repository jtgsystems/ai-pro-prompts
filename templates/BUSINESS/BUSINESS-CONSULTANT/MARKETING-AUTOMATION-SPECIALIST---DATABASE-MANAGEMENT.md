- **Tools Needed:** Platform dashboard (e.g., HubSpot), API keys, user management tools
- **Success Criteria:** Platform is activated with all required integrations set up
- **Common Pitfalls:** Choosing a platform without evaluating long-term costs or scalability needs
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 2: Data Model Design and Implementation**
- **Action:** Design the database schema based on research from Topic 1.
- **Tools Needed:** Database design software (e.g., dbdiagram.io), collaboration tools (e.g., Figma)
- **Success Criteria:** Schema is validated by a data architect or experienced specialist
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking future scalability needs, inconsistent naming conventions
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 3: Data Ingestion and Synchronization Setup**
- **Action:** Set up automated pipelines to sync data from existing systems (e.g., CRM, Google Analytics) into the new database.
- **Tools Needed:** API connectors (e.g., Zapier), ETL tools (e.g., Fivetran), monitoring services
- **Success Criteria:** Data flows correctly without errors for at least 50% of records in a test set
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing authentication credentials, incorrect data mapping causing loss or corruption
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days

**STEP 4: Data Cleansing and Quality Assurance**
- **Action:** Implement automated processes to identify and correct duplicate records, missing fields, and invalid data.
- **Tools Needed:** Deduplication tools (e.g., dedupe.io), validation scripts (Python/SQL), reporting dashboards
- **Success Criteria:** Cleaned dataset is verified by quality metrics (e.g., <1% errors)
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incomplete cleansing rules leading to residual data issues
- **Time Estimate:** 5 days

**STEP 5: Campaign and Automation Workflow Configuration**
- **Action:** Design and configure marketing automation workflows using the platform's workflow builder.
- **Tools Needed:** Platform UI, campaign templates (e.g., AWeber), testing tools (e.g., Litmus)
- **Success Criteria:** Workflows trigger correctly based on user actions or system events
- **Common Pitfalls:** Complex conditional logic leading to untested branches
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 6: Security Configuration and Access Control**
- **Action:** Implement security best practices including encryption, role-based access, and audit logging.
- **Tools Needed:** Platform built-in security settings, third-party tools (e.g., Okta), monitoring services (e.g., Splunk)
- **Success Criteria:** Security posture meets industry standards (e.g., SOC 2 compliance)
- **Common Pitfalls:** Default configurations that are too permissive
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 7: Performance Optimization and Scalability Testing**
- **Action:** Optimize database queries, indexes, and load balancing to ensure the system can handle peak loads.
- **Tools Needed:** Query optimization tools (e.g., pgBadger), load testing software (e.g., JMeter)
- **Success Criteria:** System handles 10x expected traffic without performance degradation
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking edge cases in load tests leading to unexpected failures
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 8: Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Planning**
- **Action:** Establish backup schedules, failover procedures, and disaster recovery testing protocols.
- **Tools Needed:** Backup solutions (e.g., AWS RDS snapshots), monitoring tools (e.g., Datadog)
- **Success Criteria:** Backup restores successfully within the defined RTO
- **Common Pitfalls:** Single point of failure in backups or lack of regular failover tests
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 9: Data Migration from Legacy Systems**
- **Action:** Migrate existing customer data into the new marketing automation platform.
- **Tools Needed:** ETL tools (e.g., Talend), migration scripts, validation frameworks
- **Success Criteria:** Post-migration data integrity verified across all systems
- **Common Pitfalls:** Partial migrations leading to orphaned records or broken workflows
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 10: Ongoing Maintenance and Optimization**
- **Action:** Establish a regular schedule for database audits, performance tuning, and security updates.
- **Tools Needed:** Monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana), maintenance calendars, change management platforms
- **Success Criteria:** System is regularly updated with no critical vulnerabilities or degraded performance
- **Common Pitfalls:** Neglecting routine tasks leading to degradation over time
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing

### Quality Checkpoints
