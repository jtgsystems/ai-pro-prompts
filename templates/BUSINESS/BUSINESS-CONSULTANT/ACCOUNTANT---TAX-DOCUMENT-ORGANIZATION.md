### PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

**STEP 1: [Foundation Setup]**
- **Action:** Create directory structure and subfolders for each document type (e.g., `client_name/tax_year/2024`, `tax_forms`, `correspondence`).
- **Tools Needed:** Terminal/command line, cloud storage client.
- **Success Criteria:** Folder hierarchy matches preferred_storage_location with all necessary subfolders present.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Forgetting to create parent folder or using incorrect path delimiters for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Time Estimate:** 30 minutes

**STEP 2: [Initial Document Upload]**
- **Action:** Scan and upload original hard copy documents (Form 1040, 1120) as PDFs into `tax_forms` folder with OCR text extraction.
- **Tools Needed:** Scanning device, Adobe Acrobat Pro or free online OCR tool.
- **Success Criteria:** All forms are in PDF format with searchable text.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect file naming conventions (e.g., missing year).
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 3: [Metadata Tagging]**
- **Action:** Add metadata fields for each document (date, type, client reference) using cloud storage tags or spreadsheet index.
- **Tools Needed:** Cloud storage with tagging feature, Excel/Google Sheets.
- **Success Criteria:** All documents tagged with correct metadata; no duplicates found by search.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Manual entry errors or inconsistent naming conventions across files.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour

**STEP 4: [Digital Signature Integration]**

- **Tools Needed:** DocuSign, Adobe Sign, or free alternative like HelloSign.
- **Success Criteria:** All signed documents stored in `tax_forms` with signature confirmation attached.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing electronic signature key or incomplete signing workflow.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour

**STEP 5: [Data Security Implementation]**
- **Action:** Encrypt folder at rest and in transit; set access controls (read/write/execute) based on user roles.
- **Tools Needed:** Cloud storage encryption settings, IAM policies.
- **Success Criteria:** Folder permissions match compliance checklist; data integrity confirmed via checksum.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Weak encryption or overly permissive access rights.
- **Time Estimate:** 45 minutes

**STEP 6: [Version Control Setup]**
- **Action:** Enable version history for critical documents (e.g., client correspondence).
- **Tools Needed:** Cloud storage with revision tracking, Git repository for code snippets.
- **Success Criteria:** At least three versions of each document retained; changes tracked in audit log.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overwriting files without creating backups or losing track of edits.
