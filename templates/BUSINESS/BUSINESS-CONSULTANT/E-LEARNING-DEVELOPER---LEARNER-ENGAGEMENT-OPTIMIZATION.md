3. **Long-term Metrics:**  
   - Retention Rate 30 Days Post-Course: ≥60%  
   - Referral Rate from Learners to New Courses: ≥5 new enrollments per month  

### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance against targets for each metric.  
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities (e.g., low quiz scores, high drop-off at Module 3).  
3. Implement changes based on findings (add quizzes, restructure content).  
4. Re-measure to confirm improvements.
