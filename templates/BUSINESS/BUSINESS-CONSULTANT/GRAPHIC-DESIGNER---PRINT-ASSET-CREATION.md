- **Tools Needed:** Adobe Creative Cloud suite (Photoshop, Illustrator), Dropbox for storage.
- **Success Criteria:** All assets are cataloged with metadata and organized by project folder.

#### Step 3: Pre-Design Analysis
- **Action:** Analyze existing materials to identify trends, gaps, and opportunities.
- **Tools Needed:** Adobe Bridge for asset management, Canva for quick mockups.
- **Success Criteria:** Compiled report highlighting key findings and recommendations.

#### Step 4: Concept Development & Ideation
- **Action:** Brainstorm and sketch initial design concepts based on client brief.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma or Sketch for digital sketches, Miro for collaborative whiteboards.
- **Success Criteria:** At least three concept sketches approved by client within 5 business days.

#### Step 5: Digital Prototyping
- **Action:** Create interactive prototypes of the final design in a print-ready format.
- **Tools Needed:** Adobe XD or Figma for prototyping, InVision for user testing.
- **Success Criteria:** Prototype passes basic usability tests with no errors in visual fidelity.

#### Step 6: Design Refinement & Review
- **Action:** Iterate on designs based on client feedback and internal review.
- **Tools Needed:** Adobe Photoshop for fine-tuning images, Figma for collaborative edits.
- **Success Criteria:** All revisions approved by client within 7 business days.
