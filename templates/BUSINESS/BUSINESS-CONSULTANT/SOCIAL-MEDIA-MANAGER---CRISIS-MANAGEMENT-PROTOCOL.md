## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process
**STEP 1: [Foundation Setup]**
- **Action:** Draft the Crisis Management Protocol document outlining roles, responsibilities, escalation paths, and communication templates.
- **Tools Needed:** Google Docs/Docsynergy, Notion, Confluence.
- **Success Criteria:** Document is reviewed and approved by at least one senior team member within 3 business days.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Delayed approval due to lack of stakeholder engagement; incomplete documentation.
- **Time Estimate:** 5 business days.

**STEP 2: [Initial Implementation]**
- **Action:** Conduct a tabletop exercise with the social media team using the new protocol.
- **Tools Needed:** Slack, Teams, Asana for task management.
- **Success Criteria:** Team provides feedback on clarity and completeness within 1 day of the exercise.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of participation; identifying unclear steps before execution.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days.

**STEP 3: [Integration with Monitoring Tools]**
- **Action:** Set up real-time monitoring alerts for brand mentions, sentiment analysis, and trending topics related to the crisis protocol on platforms like Brand24 or Talkwalker.
- **Tools Needed:** Brand24 (free tier), Talkwalker Alerts.
- **Success Criteria:** Alerts are configured and tested successfully within 3 business days.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect keyword setup leading to false positives; alerts not being responded to promptly.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week.

**STEP 4: [Simulation Exercise]**
- **Action:** Conduct a full-scale crisis simulation, including fake social media posts and negative reviews.
- **Tools Needed:** DZone, Facebook Business Suite for testing.
- **Success Criteria:** Team resolves the simulated issue within the set timeframe (e.g., 1 hour) without triggering escalation steps that are not intended.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-reliance on automated responses leading to miscommunication; not testing human intervention scenarios.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week.

**STEP 5: [Training & Handover]**
- **Action:** Organize a training session for all team members covering the Crisis Management Protocol, including role-specific responsibilities and how-to guides for using monitoring tools.
- **Tools Needed:** Zoom, Google Meet, or Teams meeting platform; slides in PowerPoint/Google Slides.
- **Success Criteria:** Attendance rate > 80%; post-training quiz score > 90%.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Insufficient preparation time leading to rushed training sessions; not all team members participating.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days.

**STEP 6: [Deployment and Activation]**
- **Action:** Activate the Crisis Management Protocol for real-world scenarios, such as a sudden surge in negative mentions or an unexpected outage on social media platforms.
- **Tools Needed:** Real-time monitoring dashboards (e.g., Hootsuite Insights).
- **Success Criteria:** Response to crisis is measured against predefined KPIs (time to respond, resolution rate) and meets or exceeds targets.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Delayed response leading to escalation of the issue; miscommunication between team members leads to inconsistent actions.
- **Time Estimate:** Immediate.

**STEP 7: [Post-Crisis Analysis]**
- **Action:** Conduct a post-crisis review meeting within 24 hours of the crisis resolution.
- **Tools Needed:** SurveyMonkey, Google Forms for feedback collection; Teams for meeting.
- **Success Criteria:** Documented lessons learned and action items to improve the protocol are identified and implemented within 1 month.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of follow-up; not documenting all key metrics during the crisis for review.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days.

**STEP 8: [Continuous Improvement Loop]**
- **Action:** Schedule regular reviews (e.g., quarterly) to update the Crisis Management Protocol based on lessons learned, new tools, and changes in social media policies.
- **Tools Needed:** Calendar reminders; Docs for updated protocols.
- **Success Criteria:** Updated protocol is approved by stakeholders within 1 week of review.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inadequate documentation leading to confusion during updates; resistance from team members due to lack of involvement in the revision process.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing.

2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities (e.g., slow response times, unclear roles).
3. Implement changes based on findings.
4. Re-measure to confirm improvements.
5. Repeat this cycle quarterly or after major incidents.
