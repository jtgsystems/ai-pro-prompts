## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: [Needs Analysis]**
- **Action:** Conduct surveys/interviews with department heads to identify knowledge gaps
- **Tools Needed:** SurveyMonkey, Google Forms
- **Success Criteria:** At least 80% participation rate and clear identification of top training needs
- **Common Pitfalls:** Low response rates due to unclear survey purpose
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 2: [Curriculum Design]**
- **Action:** Outline learning objectives, identify key topics, design modules using instructional models (e.g., ADDIE)
- **Tools Needed:** Lucidchart for flowcharts, Google Docs for drafts
- **Success Criteria:** Draft curriculum approved by department heads and subject matter experts
- **Common Pitfalls:** Scope creep or lack of alignment with business goals
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 3: [Learning Material Development]**
- **Action:** Create e-learning modules, PowerPoint presentations, quizzes, etc.
- **Tools Needed:** Articulate Rise for interactive courses, Canva for visuals, Zoom/Teams for recording sessions
- **Success Criteria:** All materials pass accessibility review and technical testing
- **Common Pitfalls:** Poor audio quality or inaccessible files (e.g., not captioned)
- **Time Estimate:** 3 weeks

**STEP 4: [Training Program Rollout]**
- **Action:** Schedule training sessions, conduct a pilot run with a small group, gather feedback
- **Tools Needed:** LMS for scheduling, Google Forms for feedback collection
- **Success Criteria:** Pilot participants rate satisfaction ≥80% and identify any issues
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overloading learners with content or insufficient breaks leading to fatigue
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 5: [Full Implementation]**
- **Action:** Launch curriculum to all employees, track progress, ensure compliance with documentation standards
- **Tools Needed:** LMS for tracking completion rates, HRIS for recording certifications
- **Success Criteria:** 100% of targeted workforce completes the program within the contract period
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of communication about deadlines or technical issues accessing content
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing (monthly reviews)

**STEP 6: [Assessment and Feedback Loop]**
- **Action:** Administer post-training assessments, gather qualitative feedback via surveys or focus groups
- **Tools Needed:** SurveyMonkey for post-training survey, Excel/Google Sheets for data analysis
- **Success Criteria:** Average score ≥80% on assessment and no critical issues identified in feedback
- **Common Pitfalls:** Feedback not acted upon leading to dissatisfaction among participants
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks after completion

**STEP 7: [Continuous Improvement]**
- **Action:** Analyze assessment results, identify knowledge gaps, update modules accordingly
- **Tools Needed:** Data analysis tools (Excel/Google Sheets), project management software (Asana/Trello)
- **Success Criteria:** Identified areas for improvement addressed within the next training cycle
- **Common Pitfalls:** Failing to prioritize updates or ignoring feedback due to resource constraints
