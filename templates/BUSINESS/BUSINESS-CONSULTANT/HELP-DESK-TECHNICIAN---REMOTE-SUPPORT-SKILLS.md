- **Common Pitfalls:** Misconfigured alert notifications, tickets stuck in "open" status due to lack of SLA adherence.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 2: [Remote Access Setup]**
- **Action:** Install a reputable remote access tool (TeamViewer as primary recommendation).
- **Tools Needed:** TeamViewer client, VPN connection for secure tunneling.
- **Success Criteria:** Ability to initiate a session within 30 seconds of receiving a ticket request; session logs automatically saved.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Network firewall blocking remote connections, outdated software causing compatibility issues.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour

**STEP 3: [Ticket Triage]**
- **Action:** Log into the TMS dashboard, sort tickets by priority and status.
- **Tools Needed:** TMS dashboard, filter/sort functions.
- **Success Criteria:** All open tickets categorized correctly; high-priority issues flagged for immediate attention.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missed urgent tickets due to inadequate sorting criteria.
- **Time Estimate:** 30 minutes

**STEP 4: [Remote Troubleshooting]**
- **Action:** Use remote access tool to connect, diagnose issue (check system logs, network settings).
- **Tools Needed:** Remote session client, command line tools (cmd/PowerShell), diagnostic software (Wireshark, Speakeasy).
- **Success Criteria:** Issue resolved or clearly documented with next steps; customer informed of progress.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking configuration changes in recent updates, failing to test resolution after fix.
- **Time Estimate:** Varies per ticket

**STEP 5: [Knowledge Base Update]**
- **Action:** Document the issue and solution in the help desk knowledge base (Confluence).
- **Tools Needed:** Confluence editor, version control system for articles.
- **Success Criteria:** Knowledge article created or updated within 24 hours of resolution; tags accurately reflect keywords.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Outdated information from previous versions, missing screenshots/video guides.
- **Time Estimate:** 15 minutes

**STEP 6: [Proactive Maintenance Task]**
- **Action:** Schedule a recurring maintenance task (e.g., disk cleanup) for the customer's system.
- **Tools Needed:** TMS scheduling feature, remote access software.
- **Success Criteria:** Task confirmed scheduled; customer notified of upcoming session and purpose.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missed time zone adjustments, overloading systems with too many tasks.
- **Time Estimate:** 10 minutes

**STEP 7: [Ticket Closure]**
- **Action:** Communicate resolution to the customer, confirm satisfaction (via survey).
- **Tools Needed:** TMS messaging system, feedback form link.
- **Success Criteria:** Customer confirms issue resolved; satisfaction score ≥ 4.5/5.
- **Common Pitfalls:** No follow-up communication, incomplete surveys left unanswered.
- **Time Estimate:** 30 minutes

**STEP 8: [Post-Support Analysis]**
- **Action:** Review ticket resolution time, update knowledge base, check for recurring issues.
- **Tools Needed:** TMS analytics dashboard, CRM system for customer history.
- **Success Criteria:** Average handling time < 30 mins; no repeat tickets within 7 days.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Neglecting to address systemic problems leading to future reoccurrences.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing

### Troubleshooting Guide

**Common Issues & Solutions**

| Issue | Symptoms | Likely Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------|--------------|----------|
| Remote Session Timeouts | Session disconnects after 5-10 minutes, unable to reconnect | VPN tunnel not stable, firewall blocking ports | Re-establish VPN connection, ensure port forwarding rules (TCP/UDP 443) are correctly configured in router/firewall |
| Ticket Not Resolved | Customer reports issue persists despite remote fix | Knowledge base article missing or outdated information | Update KB article with new steps and screenshots; verify customer is using the correct procedure |
| Authentication Failure | Unable to log into remote session, error message about VPN credentials | Incorrect password policy enforcement or expired passwords | Reset user account in TMS, enforce MFA if available, communicate new credentials to customer |
| Network Connectivity Issues | Cannot ping internal systems from remote session, intermittent connectivity | Misconfigured firewall rules, DNS resolution problems | Check routing table, flush DNS cache, run `nslookup` and `ping` tests to critical services |
| Automation Script Fails | Python script throws syntax error or fails to execute remotely | Incorrect path in TMS job scheduler or missing dependencies | Verify full command line with correct paths is entered; test script locally before scheduling |
