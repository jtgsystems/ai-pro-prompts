- **Tools Needed:** Git repository initialized, IDE (VS Code), Terminal.
- **Success Criteria:** Project structure set up with clear folder hierarchy and documentation of the chosen methodology.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Forgetting to update version control or not documenting naming conventions.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour

**STEP 2: [Initial Implementation]**
- **Action:** Create base CSS architecture files (e.g., variables, mixins) following the selected methodology.
- **Tools Needed:** SCSS/Sass compiler (Node-sass), Prettier for formatting, ESLint with Stylelint plugin.
- **Success Criteria:** Basic styling structure applied without syntax errors.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing environment setup for SCSS or using deprecated tools/plugins.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 3: [Core Work]**
- **Action:** Develop core components (e.g., buttons, headers) adhering to the chosen methodology and naming conventions.
- **Tools Needed:** React/Vue/Angular framework if applicable, component library documentation.
- **Success Criteria:** All components pass visual QA and follow accessibility guidelines.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overriding styles globally or not testing across browsers/devices.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours

**STEP 4: [Responsive Design Integration]**
- **Action:** Implement responsive breakpoints using media queries, ensuring consistent styling across devices.
- **Tools Needed:** CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout adjustments, Responsive Design Testing Tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools).
- **Success Criteria:** All components display correctly on at least three device sizes without overflow or misalignment.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Hardcoding breakpoints or not testing in multiple viewport sizes.
- **Time Estimate:** 1.5 hours

**STEP 5: [Accessibility Review]**
- **Action:** Conduct an accessibility audit using tools like Axe, ensuring WCAG compliance for all components.
- **Tools Needed:** Axe Accessibility Testing Tool, Lighthouse for performance insights.
- **Success Criteria:** All components pass Axe's automated checks and manual verification of color contrast and semantic HTML.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring high-priority accessibility issues flagged by the tool.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour

**STEP 6: [Performance Optimization]**
- **Action:** Optimize CSS delivery using techniques like critical path analysis, minification, and lazy loading for images/styles.
- **Tools Needed:** Webpack or Parcel bundler, PurgeCSS for unused styles removal, Lighthouse for performance metrics.
- **Success Criteria:** Page load time reduced by at least 20%, no warnings about unused styles in build output.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-optimizing and introducing visual bugs or missing critical CSS for above-the-fold content.
- **Time Estimate:** 1.5 hours

**STEP 7: [Testing & Validation]**
- **Action:** Perform cross-browser testing using tools like BrowserStack, ensure consistent styling and functionality across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **Tools Needed:** BrowserStack or Sauce Labs, Jest for unit tests.
- **Success Criteria:** All components render correctly in all target browsers without layout shifts or visual regression.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring legacy browser support requirements.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 8: [Documentation & Knowledge Transfer]**
- **Action:** Document the CSS architecture, naming conventions, and usage guidelines for team members.
- **Tools Needed:** Markdown editor (VS Code), Confluence or Notion documentation platform.
- **Success Criteria:** Documentation is complete, reviewed by at least one peer, and stored in version control.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Failing to update the README or not sharing docs with the entire team.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour

**STEP 9: [Code Review & Collaboration]**
- **Action:** Conduct a code review session with the development team, focusing on adherence to CSS architecture and best practices.
- **Tools Needed:** Pull request in GitHub/GitLab, Code Climate or SonarQube for static analysis.
- **Success Criteria:** No critical findings from static analysis tools, all changes approved by peers.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring feedback during the review process leading to repeated issues.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour

**STEP 10: [Deployment Preparation]**
- **Action:** Prepare the project for deployment, ensuring all CSS is compiled and optimized according to production settings.
- **Tools Needed:** Netlify or Vercel for CI/CD pipelines, Build Hooks in repository.
- **Success Criteria:** Project builds successfully on each push to the main branch without errors.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing environment variables or not configuring the build process correctly.
- **Time Estimate:** 30 minutes

### Quality Checkpoints
Insert checkpoints between major steps:
- **Checkpoint 1:** [After Step X] - Verify that the project structure adheres to the chosen CSS methodology and is properly version-controlled.
- **Checkpoint 2:** [After Step Y] - Validate that all components are accessible using Axe and meet WCAG standards.
- **Checkpoint 3:** [After Step Z] - Ensure no critical performance issues are identified in Lighthouse audits.
