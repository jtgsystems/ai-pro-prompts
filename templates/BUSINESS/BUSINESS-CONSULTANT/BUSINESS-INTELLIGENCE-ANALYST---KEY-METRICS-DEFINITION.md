## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: [Metric Ideation]**
- **Action:** Conduct workshops to brainstorm potential metrics.
- **Tools Needed:** Miro or Lucidchart for ideation sessions, Google Docs for documentation.
- **Success Criteria:** Minimum of 5 viable metric ideas documented.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Scope creep; ensure all ideas are actionable.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks.

**STEP 2: [Data Source Validation]**
- **Action:** Verify data availability and quality from each source.
- **Tools Needed:** Python scripts for data profiling, SQL queries to test schema compatibility.
- **Success Criteria:** All critical data sources validated; gaps identified and mitigated.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing data handling strategies; ensure all metrics can be tracked without missing data.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week.

**STEP 3: [Metric Definition and Alignment]**
- **Action:** Define each metric, its purpose, and how it aligns with business objectives.
- **Tools Needed:** Excel or Google Sheets for draft definitions, stakeholder feedback tools like SurveyMonkey.
- **Success Criteria:** Each metric is defined in a shared document; approved by at least 2 stakeholders.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Misalignment with business goals; conduct alignment meetings.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week.

**STEP 4: [Data Integration and Automation]**
- **Action:** Set up data pipelines to automate metric calculations.
- **Tools Needed:** Python for ETL scripts, Power BI or Tableau for real-time dashboards.
- **Success Criteria:** Automated metrics are displayed on a dashboard within the specified timeframe (e.g., 24 hours).
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect data formatting; test each pipeline thoroughly before deployment.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks.

**STEP 5: [Visualization and Reporting]**
- **Action:** Design dashboards that present metrics clearly to stakeholders.
- **Tools Needed:** Tableau or Power BI for dashboard design, HTML/CSS for UI customization.
- **Success Criteria:** Dashboards are live; they can be accessed remotely by all relevant teams.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overloading the dashboard with too much data; focus on top 3-5 metrics per domain.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week.

**STEP 6: [Stakeholder Review and Feedback Loop]**
- **Action:** Present initial metrics to stakeholders for feedback.
- **Tools Needed:** Google Meet or Teams for virtual presentations, SurveyMonkey for structured feedback.
- **Success Criteria:** At least 70% of stakeholders provide positive feedback; identified issues are addressed.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring negative feedback; iterate based on input.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing.

**STEP 7: [Performance Review and Adjustment]**
- **Action:** Regularly review metric performance against business objectives.
- **Tools Needed:** Power BI for KPI tracking, Python scripts for automated alerts when metrics fall below thresholds.
- **Success Criteria:** Metrics are reviewed quarterly; adjustments made as needed to stay aligned with goals.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of follow-up on review meetings; ensure action items from reviews are documented and tracked.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing.

## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

### Performance Metrics
Define how to measure success:

   - User adoption rate (percentage of teams using dashboards): Target = 95%
   - Stakeholder satisfaction score: Target = 85%
   - Time to resolve data issues: Target = <48 hours

3. **Long-term Metrics:**
   - Overall business performance improvement (e.g., revenue growth, cost reduction)
     - Target: 10% year-over-year
     - Measurement Method: Compare financial KPIs before and after metric implementation.

### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance against targets.
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities.
3. Implement changes based on feedback or identified gaps.
4. Re-measure to ensure metrics are meeting objectives.
