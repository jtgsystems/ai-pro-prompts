### Execution Steps:

**STEP 1: [Inventory of All Databases]**
- **Action:** List all databases in your environment, including:
  - Production
  - Staging
  - Development
  - Backup copies
- **Tools Needed:** Database inventory tool (e.g., AWS RDS Inventory), SQL query to list databases.
- **Success Criteria:** Complete and up-to-date database inventory with no duplicates.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Omitting shadow or backup databases, failing to account for encrypted environments.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 2: [Assess Current Maintenance Procedures]**
- **Action:** Review existing maintenance schedules:
  - Backup frequency and retention
  - Performance tuning cycles
  - Patch management timelines
- **Tools Needed:** Documentation repository (e.g., Confluence), Change Management System.
- **Success Criteria:** Documented and approved maintenance procedures for each database type.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Outdated or missing SOPs, lack of stakeholder sign-off.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days

**STEP 3: [Define Maintenance Schedule Templates]**
- **Action:** Create standardized templates:
  - Backup schedule
  - Performance tuning plan
  - Patch deployment checklist
- **Tools Needed:** Word/Google Docs for template creation, version control system (Git).
- **Success Criteria:** At least one approved maintenance schedule template per database type.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inconsistent formatting or missing key sections.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 4: [Implement Automated Maintenance Tasks]**
- **Action:** Set up automated processes:
  - Backup jobs using tools like AWS Database Snapshots, Azure Database Backups
  - Performance indexing with SQL scripts
  - Log file cleanup tasks
- **Tools Needed:** Automation platform (e.g., Ansible), Cloud provider console.
- **Success Criteria:** Automated maintenance completes without human intervention for at least one full cycle.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Script errors, resource constraints during automation rollout.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 days

**STEP 5: [Establish Monitoring and Alerting]**
- **Action:** Configure monitoring tools to:
  - Track backup success rates
  - Detect performance degradation
  - Identify unauthorized access attempts
- **Tools Needed:** Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for dashboards.
- **Success Criteria:** Alerts fire correctly in test scenarios (e.g., simulating a failed backup).
- **Common Pitfalls:** False positives/negatives due to poorly tuned thresholds.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 6: [Change Management Integration]**
- **Action:** Integrate maintenance tasks into existing change management process:
  - Submit maintenance requests
  - Review and approve changes
  - Post-execution validation
- **Tools Needed:** Change Management System (Jira Service Management), Communication platform (Slack).
- **Success Criteria:** All maintenance activities logged, approved, and documented in CMDB.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking dependencies between database tasks and application releases.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 7: [Run a Full Maintenance Cycle Test]**
- **Action:** Execute a complete maintenance cycle on a non-production copy:
  - Backup -> Performance Tuning -> Patch Deployment
- **Tools Needed:** Same as above, but in staging environment.
- **Success Criteria:** All steps completed successfully without errors.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Environment mismatch leading to unnoticed issues.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 8: [Roll Out Maintenance Schedule to Production]**
- **Action:** Gradually implement the schedule:
  - Start with low-risk databases
  - Monitor closely for first week
- **Tools Needed:** Monitoring dashboards, Incident response platform (e.g., PagerDuty).
- **Success Criteria:** No unplanned downtime or alerts triggered during rollout.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Rushed implementation leading to skipped steps or missed approvals.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 9: [Post-Implementation Review and Optimization]**
- **Action:** After the initial period:
  - Evaluate maintenance execution times
  - Analyze downtime incidents before/after
  - Adjust schedules based on feedback
- **Tools Needed:** SQL performance monitoring, Incident tracking system.
- **Success Criteria:** Maintenance schedule achieves >95% compliance with documented goals.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of data to drive optimization decisions.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing
