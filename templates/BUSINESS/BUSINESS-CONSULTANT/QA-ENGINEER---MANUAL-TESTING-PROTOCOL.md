### PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

#### Step-by-Step Process
**STEP 1: [Requirement Analysis]**
- **Action:** Review functional requirements document for clarity and completeness.
- **Tools Needed:** Markdown editor (e.g., VS Code), Google Docs link.
- **Success Criteria:** All requirements are verified against the software specifications.

**STEP 2: [Test Case Development]**
- **Action:** Create detailed test cases using keywords like "Given/When/Then" for user stories.
- **Tools Needed:** Zephyr Open Source, Confluence page.
- **Success Criteria:** Each functional requirement has at least one corresponding test case.

**STEP 3: [Environment Setup]**
- **Action:** Prepare testing environment mirroring production with relevant configurations.
- **Tools Needed:** Docker Compose for local setup, Terraform for infrastructure as code.
- **Success Criteria:** Environment replicates target release build and user roles.

**STEP 4: [Test Data Preparation]**
- **Action:** Generate realistic test data using scripts or manual entries.
- **Tools Needed:** Faker library (Python), Excel for complex datasets.
- **Success Criteria:** Test data covers edge cases, invalid inputs, and large datasets.

**STEP 5: [Manual Execution of Test Cases]**
- **Action:** Execute each test case manually, documenting results in defect tracking system.
- **Tools Needed:** Jira Bug Tracking, Redmine issue tracker.
- **Success Criteria:** All test cases pass without critical defects; any issues are logged and prioritized.

**STEP 6: [Regression Testing](Optional)**
- **Action:** Re-run a subset of key tests after each code change to ensure no regressions.
- **Tools Needed:** Jenkins pipeline, GitHub Actions workflow.
- **Success Criteria:** No new critical defects introduced by changes; regression rate <5%.

**STEP 7: [Reporting Defects]**
- **Action:** Log detailed defect reports including steps to reproduce and screenshots/videos if needed.
- **Tools Needed:** Jira ticket creation form, Miro board for visual documentation.
- **Success Criteria:** All identified defects are triaged within 24 hours.

**STEPS 6-10+:** [Define additional standard practice steps]
- **Step 6a:** Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.
- **Step 6b:** Perform usability testing using tools like Maze or UsabilityHub.
- **Step 7:** Validate performance under load using k6 or JMeter.

#### Quality Checkpoints
**Checkpoint 1:** After Step 2 - Verify all test cases align with requirements (Coverage >90%).
**Checkpoint 2:** After Step 4 - Confirm data integrity and accessibility across environments.
**Checkpoint 3:** After Step 5 - Ensure defect density is within acceptable limits (<2 critical per build).
