- **Tools Needed:** Internal wiki with API access or manual web browser.
- **Success Criteria:** Relevant article found within 2 minutes.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Failing to find solution leads to generic response.
- **Time Estimate:** <3 minutes

**STEP 4: Remote Access (if needed)**
- **Action:** Initiate remote session via secure connection, walk user through steps.
- **Tools Needed:** TeamViewer/LogMeIn with MFA enabled.
- **Success Criteria:** Issue resolved during remote session or a clear plan for next steps established.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Remote access declined due to security concerns.
- **Time Estimate:** Varies

**STEP 5: System-Level Troubleshooting**
- **Action:** Check logs, restart services, update drivers if applicable.
- **Tools Needed:** Event Viewer, PowerShell, driver repositories (e.g., Dell/HP).
- **Success Criteria:** Issue persists after all system-level steps are exhausted.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking critical logs leading to repeated attempts.
- **Time Estimate:** <15 minutes

**STEP 6: Vendor-Specific Support**
- **Action:** Contact vendor support, provide case number for cross-team issue tracking.
- **Tools Needed:** Vendor portal/phone system, ticket linking feature in ITSM platform.
- **Success Criteria:** Vendor provides resolution or definitive next steps within SLA time.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Delayed response from vendor leading to extended downtime.
- **Time Estimate:** Varies

**STEP 7: Documentation of Resolution**
- **Action:** Update knowledge base with root cause and fix, close ticket in ITSM system.
- **Tools Needed:** Ticketing system API or manual UI access.
- **Success Criteria:** Knowledge base entry created within 1 hour of resolution.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Failing to document solution leading to repeat incidents.
- **Time Estimate:** <15 minutes

**STEP 8: Follow-Up Communication**
- **Action:** Inform user that issue resolved, provide any necessary steps for future prevention.
- **Tools Needed:** Email/SMS notification system.
- **Success Criteria:** User acknowledges resolution within 10 minutes of follow-up.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of acknowledgement leads to unresolved issues.

### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance against targets.
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities (e.g., training gaps, process bottlenecks).
3. Implement changes (e.g., new scripts, updated SOPs).
4. Re-measure metrics to validate impact.
5. Repeat until all targets are met.
