**Action:** 
- Define roles and permissions using role-based access controls within the VPS environment.
- Limit access to PHI only by necessary personnel based on job requirements.

**Tools Needed:**
- **Access Management:** sudo (built-in), LDAP Server (open-source) for user management

**Success Criteria:**
- Only authorized users can access directories containing PHI.
- Audit logs are enabled and accessible for all access attempts.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Over-permissioning of users who do not need access to PHI.
- Failure to regularly review access permissions.

#### Step 4: Data Encryption in Transit (Time Estimate: Ongoing)
**Action:** 
- Ensure that all data transferred over the internet is encrypted using SFTP/SCP.
- Regularly update encryption keys and avoid weak passwords.

**Tools Needed:**
- **Encryption Tools:** OpenSSL, GnuPG

**Success Criteria:**
- All data transfers are logged and encrypted.
- Key rotation policies are in place for managing encryption keys.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Using weak or default encryption keys.
- Forgetting to rotate encryption keys regularly.

#### Step 5: Data Encryption at Rest (Time Estimate: 1 hour)
**Action:** 
- Encrypt all data stored on the VPS using full-disk encryption and file-level encryption for PHI files.
- Utilize AES256 encryption standard recommended by NIST.

**Tools Needed:**
- **Encryption Software:** LUKS2 (part of Linux Unified Key Setup), VeraCrypt

**Success Criteria:**
- All storage volumes are encrypted with verified keys.
- Regular backups are also encrypted.

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Neglecting to encrypt backups.
- Using weak or non-standard encryption algorithms.

#### Step 6: Secure Remote Work Practices (Time Estimate: Ongoing)
