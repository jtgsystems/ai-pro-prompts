- Tools Needed: Shopify Admin Interface
- Success Criteria: Store is live on the internet, accessible via its domain
- Common Pitfalls: Incorrect DNS configuration leading to site downtime
- Time Estimate: 15 minutes

**STEP 2: [Choose Payment Gateway]**
- Action: Research and select a payment gateway (e.g., Stripe for international transactions)
- Tools Needed: Browser-based comparison tools like SCA Portal, Price Comparison Websites
- Success Criteria: Selected gateway meets PCI DSS compliance requirements and offers necessary API access
- Common Pitfalls: Selecting a gateway without proper encryption support
- Time Estimate: 30 minutes

**STEP 3: [Integrate Payment Gateway]**
- Action: Install the selected payment gateway's Shopify app from the App Marketplace
- Tools Needed: Shopify Admin Interface, Terminal (for custom configurations)
- Success Criteria: The app is active and integrated without errors in settings
- Common Pitfalls: Missing required permissions during installation causing API access issues
- Time Estimate: 1 hour

**STEP 4: [Configure Payment Settings]**
- Action: Configure payment settings within the Shopify admin to default to the selected gateway
- Tools Needed: Shopify Admin Interface, Browser Developer Tools for troubleshooting network requests
- Success Criteria: Default payment method is set to the chosen gateway with proper API keys
- Common Pitfalls: Incorrectly mapping the gateway's API key leading to authentication failures
- Time Estimate: 45 minutes

**STEP 5: [Implement PCI DSS Compliance]**
- Action: Use Shopify's built-in tools (e.g., Vault) to securely store payment credentials
- Tools Needed: Shopify Admin Interface, Vault feature in Shopify
- Success Criteria: All sensitive data is stored encrypted with a secure token
- Common Pitfalls: Storing raw credit card numbers violating PCI DSS rules
- Time Estimate: 2 hours

**STEP 6: [Test Payment Flow]**
- Action: Perform end-to-end testing of the checkout process including successful and failed transactions
- Tools Needed: Browser Developer Tools, Postman for manual API calls
- Success Criteria: All test scenarios pass without errors; average processing time < 2 seconds
- Common Pitfalls: Network latency causing timeouts during token retrieval
- Time Estimate: 1 hour

**STEP 7: [Configure Error Handling]**
- Action: Set up centralized logging and monitoring for payment-related errors (Sentry, Datadog)
- Tools Needed: Sentry or Datadog Dashboard, Shopify Admin Alerts
- Success Criteria: All payment errors are logged with sufficient detail for root cause analysis
- Common Pitfalls: Failing to configure alerts leading to unnoticed downtime during peak traffic
- Time Estimate: 30 minutes

**STEP 8: [Automate Deployment Process]**
- Action: Configure CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automatically deploy changes
- Tools Needed: GitHub Repository, Shopify App Marketplace API, CI/CD Platform (e.g., GitHub Actions)
- Success Criteria: New configurations are deployed without manual intervention and do not break the site
- Common Pitfalls: Incorrectly mapping environment variables causing deployment failures
- Time Estimate: 2 hours

**STEP 9: [Performance Optimization]**
- Action: Implement caching for frequently accessed payment data (e.g., rates, fees)
- Tools Needed: Redis or Memcached server, Shopify Theme Editor
- Success Criteria: Page load time improves by at least 1 second during peak traffic conditions
- Common Pitfalls: Over-caching leading to stale data causing incorrect transaction results
- Time Estimate: 2 hours

**STEP 10: [Final Review & Documentation]**
- Action: Conduct a final review of the payment configuration with stakeholders
- Tools Needed: Document management system (e.g., Notion, Confluence)
- Success Criteria: All documentation is up-to-date and includes API keys stored securely
- Common Pitfalls: Missing or outdated documentation causing future maintenance issues
- Time Estimate: 1 hour

### Troubleshooting Section
**Common Issues & Solutions**

1. **Transaction Fails with "Invalid Credentials"**
   - Check that the payment gateway's API key is correctly entered in the Shopify admin.
   - Verify that SSL/TLS certificates are properly configured for both the app and your store.

2. **API Rate Limit Exceeded**
   - Implement caching strategies to reduce the number of API calls (e.g., use Redis).
   - Schedule frequent but smaller batches of data updates instead of large ones.

3. **PCI DSS Violations Detected**
   - Ensure all sensitive payment information is stored in Shopify's Vault.
   - Regularly run Shopify's PCI compliance scan and address any findings immediately.

4. **High Latency During Checkout**
   - Optimize network latency by minimizing API call frequency.
   - Consider using a CDN to serve static assets like images or scripts related to the checkout process.

5. **Failed Deployments Causing Store Downtime**
   - Use feature flags to toggle between old and new configurations during deployment.
   - Set up rollback procedures in your CI/CD pipeline for quick recovery.
