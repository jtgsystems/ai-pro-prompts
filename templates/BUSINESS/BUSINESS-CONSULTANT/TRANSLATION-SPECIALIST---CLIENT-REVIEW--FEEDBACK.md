## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: [Project Kickoff and Preparation]**
- **Action:** Conduct a virtual kickoff meeting to align on scope, deliverables, and timeline; create shared project workspace.  
- **Tools Needed:** Zoom/Teams for video conferencing, Google Drive/Dropbox for file sharing, Trello or Asana for task tracking.  
- **Success Criteria:** Meeting minutes recorded, clear agreement on deliverables, all source materials uploaded to shared drive.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Miscommunication about scope, missing documentation in shared workspace.  
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours.

**STEP 2: [Initial Translation Draft]**
- **Action:** Translate the first document segment using CAT tool; apply terminology guidelines from style guide.  
- **Tools Needed:** SDL Trados Studio (free version), MemoQ, Google Docs for drafting.  
- **Success Criteria:** First draft completed with all key terms tagged and reviewed by a colleague.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrectly tagging terminology, neglecting to follow client's tone guidelines.  
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours.

**STEP 3: [First Round Review]**
- **Action:** Run through the translation using automated QA tools; conduct peer review with another translator specializing in the domain.  
- **Tools Needed:** CAT tool for linguistic checks, Google Docs Comments, Proofreading services (e.g., ProWritingAid).  
- **Success Criteria:** No major grammatical errors identified, all client-specific feedback incorporated.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Skipping over stylistic notes from reviewers, ignoring cultural context in adjustments.  
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours.

**STEP 4: [Final Polish and Client Review]**
- **Action:** Incorporate any remaining feedback; perform final proofreading for formatting and consistency.  
- **Tools Needed:** Final QA checklists, PDF comparison tools (e.g., Diff Checker), client collaboration platform (Google Docs shared with read-only access).  
- **Success Criteria:** Client can review the document without edit rights; all changes approved in a signed agreement.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Changes made after approval but before final sign-off; formatting errors post-proofread.  
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours.

**STEP 5: [Client Feedback Collection]**
- **Action:** Share the final version with client for review; gather structured feedback using a survey tool or template.  
- **Tools Needed:** Google Forms for surveys, SurveyMonkey (optional), client email for delivery.  
- **Success Criteria:** Client provides overall satisfaction rating of 4/5 or higher and specific comments within 72 hours.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Surveys not completed, feedback not actionable due to lack of context.  
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour.

**STEP 6: [Post-Survey Analysis]**
- **Action:** Compile client feedback; categorize by satisfaction level (satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied) and specific issues noted.  
- **Tools Needed:** Excel or Google Sheets for data analysis, NLP tools for sentiment analysis (optional).  
- **Success Criteria:** At least 95% of clients rate the project as satisfactory; no systemic issues identified across multiple projects.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking negative comments due to focus on positive feedback, ignoring recurring themes.  
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours.

**STEP 7: [Project Closure and Documentation]**
- **Action:** Archive all documents in the shared workspace; prepare a final project report for client including deliverables, quality metrics, and areas of improvement.  
- **Tools Needed:** Version control (Git), documentation platform like Confluence or Notion.  
- **Success Criteria:** All files archived, no unfinished tasks left open, feedback loop closed with actionable insights.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Leaving unarchived files, failing to update knowledge base with lessons learned.  
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour.

**STEP 8: [Knowledge Transfer and Continuous Improvement]**
- **Action:** Conduct a debrief meeting with the team; document what worked well, areas for improvement, and any innovative practices observed during the project.  
- **Tools Needed:** Teams/Zoom for meeting, Confluence for documentation, Trello for action items.  
- **Success Criteria:** Actionable recommendations documented, shared across teams, continuous improvement plan initiated.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Documenting without distributing to relevant stakeholders, not scheduling follow-up reviews.  
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour.
