### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance against targets using the defined metrics.  
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities from analysis of feedback and automated tools.  
3. Implement changes (e.g., adjust dialogue pacing, refine character arcs).  
4. Re-measure to confirm improvements meet targets.  
5. Repeat until all primary and secondary goals are achieved.
