## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process
**STEP 1: [Content Mapping & Modularization]**
- **Action:** Create a content inventory using the target learner profile, primary topic, and learning objectives. Break down into modules aligned with SAM phases (Activate, Engage, Explore, Apply).  
- **Tools Needed:** Excel/Google Sheets for mapping; Lucidchart or Miro for visual flowcharts.  
- **Success Criteria:** All core content areas are represented in at least one module, each module has a clear purpose and learning outcome.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overloading modules (minimum 5-7 per learner) or creating siloed content that cannot be reused.  
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours for mapping + 1 hour for initial review.

**STEP 2: [Initial Module Drafting]**
- **Action:** Develop the first module using a modular design framework like SAM. Include text, audio, video, and interactive elements based on research topic outcomes.  
- **Tools Needed:** Adobe Captivate/Articulate Rise (optional), Lectoria, Articulate Storyline, or free tools like Canvas + Google Docs for authoring.  
- **Success Criteria:** Draft meets accessibility standards and incorporates all required content formats; peer review feedback score ≥ 4/5.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Neglecting alt-text, not testing on mobile devices, missing analytics integration points.  
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days for development + 1 day for internal QA.

**STEP 3: [Accessibility Review]**
- **Action:** Run the draft through automated accessibility tools (e.g., WAVE, Axe) and manual review against WCAG 2.1 AA checklist.  
- **Tools Needed:** WAVE, Axe browser extensions; AXE JavaScript library.  
- **Success Criteria:** Zero critical errors, ≥90% of all important elements pass AA compliance tests.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Relying solely on automated tools, ignoring keyboard navigation issues.  
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour for automated testing + 2 hours for manual review.

**STEP 4: [Prototyping & User Testing]**
- **Action:** Create a clickable prototype using free tool like Adobe XD or Figma. Conduct usability tests with target learner profile on devices relevant to the platform (e.g., tablets).  
- **Tools Needed:** Adobe XD, Figma, Google Forms for collecting feedback.  
- **Success Criteria:** 80% of test users complete tasks without errors; key action items addressed in subsequent iterations.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking real-world usage scenarios (e.g., limited bandwidth), not testing with diverse learners.  
- **Time Estimate:** Prototype creation + 2 user testing sessions.

**STEP 5: [Integration into LMS]**
- **Action:** Export the module as SCORM package and import it into the selected LMS platform. Configure tracking, quizzes, and progress bars according to research topic findings.  
- **Tools Needed:** LMS API documentation; SCORM validation tool (e.g., Scorm Cloud).  
- **Success Criteria:** Module loads correctly in all target browsers/devices; learning paths work as intended; analytics data syncs accurately.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing required fields during import, not testing authentication flow.

**STEP 6: [Iterative Refinement]**
- **Action:** Gather user feedback from initial learners (e.g., surveys after each module). Update content based on accessibility issues flagged by tools or usability problems identified in testing.  
- **Tools Needed:** SurveyMonkey; InVision for collaborative iteration.  
- **Success Criteria:** Reduction of critical errors to 0; increase in learner satisfaction score ≥ 4/5 post-refinement.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring low-priority feedback, not repeating steps until metrics are met.

**STEPS 7-10+:** [Additional Steps Based on Complexity]
- Develop next module using modular design.
- Conduct accessibility review and user testing for new content.
- Integrate analytics tracking into learning paths.
- Create learner support resources (FAQs, help center).

### Quality Checkpoints
```yaml
- After Step 1: Verify all core content areas represented and no siloed modules.
- After Step 2: Ensure drafts meet accessibility standards and align with learning objectives.
- After Step 4: Validate prototype meets usability criteria for target learner profile.
- After Step 5: Confirm module functions correctly in LMS and data syncs accurately.
```
