### Execution Workflow

#### Step 1: Baseline Model Deployment Setup
- **Action:** Containerize model using Docker, deploy to Kubernetes cluster.
- **Tools Needed:** Docker Desktop (free), GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD (free), Kubernetes (optional k8s cluster like EKS).
- **Success Criteria:** Model successfully deployed and serving predictions without errors in staging environment.

#### Step 2: Data Ingestion Monitoring
- **Action:** Implement data pipelines to capture input features and model outputs.
- **Tools Needed:** Apache Kafka (free), Airflow for scheduling, Prometheus for metrics collection.
- **Success Criteria:** Real-time logs of feature ingestion rates >99.9%.

#### Step 3: Performance Metrics Tracking
- **Action:** Set up dashboards in Grafana to monitor latency, throughput, and accuracy over time.
- **Tools Needed:** Prometheus + Grafana (free), InfluxDB for time-series storage.
- **Success Criteria:** Automated alerts triggered if latency >200ms or accuracy drops <95% for 30 consecutive hours.

#### Step 4: Data Drift Detection
- **Action:** Implement statistical models to detect changes in data distributions.
- **Tools Needed:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow Probability (free), Python libraries for statistical testing.
- **Success Criteria:** System detects drift with >5% change in key metrics and logs the event.

#### Step 5: Anomaly Detection Systems
- **Action:** Integrate unsupervised learning models to identify unexpected model behavior.
- **Tools Needed:** Scikit-learn, PyOD (open-source), AWS SageMaker's built-in anomaly detection.
- **Success Criteria:** System flags anomalies within 30 seconds and logs the event.

#### Step 6: Model Drift Correction Workflow
- **Action:** Automate retraining pipeline triggered by drift alerts.
- **Tools Needed:** Feature store, CI/CD pipelines for model updates.
- **Success Criteria:** Retrained model deployed within 24 hours of alert triggering without downtime.

#### Step 7: A/B Testing Implementation
- **Action:** Randomly route a subset of traffic to the new model version.
- **Tools Needed:** Split testing libraries (Differential), Google Analytics, Feature flags in LaunchDarkly or similar.
- **Success Criteria:** Statistical significance achieved (>95%) and both models perform within latency thresholds.

#### Step 8: Logging and Auditing Setup
- **Action:** Implement comprehensive logging for all model interactions.
- **Tools Needed:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Loki + Grafana stack (free).
- **Success Criteria:** Logs accessible via Kibana dashboard with drilldown capabilities.

#### Step 9: Incident Response Protocols
- **Action:** Document and automate response to common failures.
- **Tools Needed:** PagerDuty for alerting, runbooks in Confluence or Notion.
- **Success Criteria:** Average MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery) <30 minutes during simulated incidents.

#### Step 10: Continuous Improvement Review
- **Action:** Weekly review of monitoring dashboards and incident reports.
- **Tools Needed:** Team collaboration tools like Slack, Jira for ticketing.
- **Success Criteria:** No critical alerts remain unaddressed; metrics improvement trends validated.

### Troubleshooting Section

**Common Issues & Solutions:**
1. **Model Serving Latency:** Check container resource limits, optimize inference code using vectorization.
2. **Data Drift Alerts:** Validate data freshness of training set, increase sampling rate for recent data.
3. **Drift Correction Failures:** Ensure feature store has latest version; verify model can be retrained with new data.
4. **Logging Gaps:** Verify log forwarding to monitoring system, check container logging configurations.
5. **Incident Response Bottlenecks:** Automate alerts via Slack or email, use runbooks for clear action steps.

**Advanced Debugging:**
- Use distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) to visualize request flow across microservices.
- Implement feature flag-based rollback mechanisms for instant revert to previous model version.
- Conduct chaos engineering experiments using tools like Gremlin or Litmus.
