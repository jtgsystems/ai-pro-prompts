  - Human Proofreaders (target language) review translated PDFs for format issues
  - Automated Tools run checks on output files
  - Peer Review with QA team for consistency  
- **Tools Needed:** PDF diff tools (InDesign, Adobe Acrobat), Automated checks via plugins  

**STEP 5: [Format Validation]**
- **Action:** Validate each translated document against the master formatting matrix
- **Tools Needed:** Custom validation scripts (Node.js free), Formatting audit toolkits (optional)  
- **Success Criteria:** All documents pass format validation without errors  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooked alignment issues, inconsistent pagination  
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours per document  

**STEP 6: [Iterative Reformatting]**
- **Action:** Address any formatting discrepancies flagged during validation
- **Tools Needed:** Desktop publishing software (InDesign free), Automated reformat scripts  

**STEP 7: [Final Review & Sign-off]**
- **Action:** Conduct a final review with stakeholders
