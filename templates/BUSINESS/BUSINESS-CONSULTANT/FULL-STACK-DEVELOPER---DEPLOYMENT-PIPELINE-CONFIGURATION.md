### PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

#### Step-by-Step Process
**STEP 1: [Version Control & Code Commitment]**
- **Action:** Push updated code to the main branch after thorough testing.
- **Tools Needed:** Git, GitHub Actions or Jenkins CI/CD server.
- **Success Criteria:** Successful push notification and automated build trigger.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Forgetting to enable `auto-start` in CI service; missing dependencies listed in Dockerfile.
- **Time Estimate:** 30 minutes

**STEP 2: [Automated Testing]**
- **Action:** Run unit tests, integration tests using Jest/Mocha or similar frameworks.
- **Tools Needed:** GitHub Actions/Jenkins pipeline, Docker for test environment setup.
- **Success Criteria:** All tests pass with a green status; no failed assertions.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Tests failing due to flaky database access in CI; missing mock data configuration.
- **Time Estimate:** 15 minutes

**STEP 3: [Build and Package Container]**
- **Action:** Use Dockerfile to build the application image, tagging with commit SHA.
- **Tools Needed:** Docker CLI, GitHub Actions/Jenkins for automated build trigger.
- **Success Criteria:** Docker image built successfully; tag matches commit version.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Build fails due to missing dependencies in Dockerfile or incorrect network ports.
- **Time Estimate:** 20 minutes

**STEP 4: [Security Scanning]**
- **Action:** Run OWASP Dependency Check or Trivy for vulnerabilities on the container image.
- **Tools Needed:** GitHub Actions/Jenkins, Trivy, OWASP Dependency Checker.
- **Success Criteria:** No high-severity vulnerabilities; report summary generated.
- **Common Pitfalls:** False positives leading to false failure of CI pipeline.
- **Time Estimate:** 10 minutes

**STEP 5: [Deploy to Staging Environment]**
- **Action:** Deploy the image to a staging Kubernetes cluster or serverless environment for validation.
- **Tools Needed:** Helm charts, Terraform scripts, AWS SAM CLI.
- **Success Criteria:** Application accessible at specified URL; health checks pass.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Network connectivity issues between services in staging.
- **Time Estimate:** 30 minutes

**STEP 6: [Automated Testing in Staging]**
- **Action:** Execute integration tests against the deployed staging environment.
- **Tools Needed:** Cypress, Postman for API testing; Docker Compose for local dependencies.
- **Success Criteria:** All test cases pass; no failures reported.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Environment variables not correctly passed to Docker containers.
- **Time Estimate:** 20 minutes

**STEP 7: [Code Review and Approval]**
- **Action:** Peer review of deployment changes by at least one other developer.
- **Tools Needed:** GitHub Pull Request, GitLab Merge Request.
- **Success Criteria:** All code reviews approved; no open critical issues.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing reviewer approval leading to pipeline blockage.
- **Time Estimate:** 15 minutes

**STEP 8: [Deploy to Production Environment]**
- **Action:** Promote the build from staging to production environment following blue-green or canary strategy.
- **Tools Needed:** Terraform for infrastructure changes, Kubernetes rolling updates.
- **Success Criteria:** Traffic shifted to new version without service interruption; health checks pass.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Misconfiguration of routing causing 404 errors; rollback needed.
- **Time Estimate:** 45 minutes

**STEP 9: [Post-deployment Validation]**
- **Action:** Run smoke tests and monitor application performance using Prometheus/Grafana dashboards.
- **Tools Needed:** Grafana for monitoring, Kibana/Elasticsearch for logs.
- **Success Criteria:** Application stable with no errors; metrics within expected ranges.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Monitoring alerts not properly configured leading to undetected issues.
- **Time Estimate:** 30 minutes

**STEP 10: [Final Acceptance and Documentation]**
- **Action:** Verify all features work as expected in production; document changes for future reference.
- **Tools Needed:** User acceptance testing, Confluence/Notion documentation platform.
- **Success Criteria:** Stakeholder sign-off achieved; comprehensive deployment log available.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of rollback plan or incomplete documentation leading to knowledge gaps.
- **Time Estimate:** 15 minutes

### Quality Checkpoints
```yaml
- After Step 2: Verify all tests pass and no flaky failures.
- After Step 4: Ensure security scan reports show zero high-severity issues.
- After Step 6: Confirm staging environment passes all integration tests.
```
