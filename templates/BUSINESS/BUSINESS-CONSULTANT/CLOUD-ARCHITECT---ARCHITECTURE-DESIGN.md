### PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW  

#### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: [Foundation Setup]**
- **Action:** Create a cloud architecture repository (e.g., Confluence) and define the project scope.  
- **Tools Needed:** Confluence, Git (GitHub/GitLab), Markdown editor (VS Code).  
- **Success Criteria:** Documented architecture blueprint with stakeholder approval.

**STEP 2: [Initial Implementation]**
- **Action:** Draft high-level cloud design including regions, availability zones, and service models.  
- **Tools Needed:** Lucidchart or draw.io for diagrams; Terraform for IaC snippets.  
- **Success Criteria:** Approved high-level architecture diagram with stakeholder feedback.

**STEP 3: [Core Work]**
- **Action:** Define detailed components (compute, storage, networking) and map them to specific cloud services.  
- **Tools Needed:** AWS/Azure/GCP console for service selection; Terraform scripts.  
- **Success Criteria:** Detailed architecture document with each component assigned a specific provider resource.

**STEP 4: [Security Hardening]**
- **Action:** Implement IAM policies, network security groups (NAT/NACL), and encryption configurations.  
- **Tools Needed:** AWS IAM console, Azure Policy, HashiCorp Vault for secrets management.  
- **Success Criteria:** Security audit passes with no critical findings.

**STEP 5: [Observability Setup]**
- **Action:** Configure logging, monitoring, and alerting pipelines.  
- **Tools Needed:** CloudWatch/Stackdriver, Prometheus/Grafana, Datadog.  
- **Success Criteria:** End-to-end monitoring coverage with defined SLAs for alerts.

**STEP 6: [Disaster Recovery Planning]**
- **Action:** Define replication strategies, backup schedules, and failover procedures.  
- **Tools Needed:** Azure Site Recovery, AWS Backup, Terraform scripts for DR site provisioning.
