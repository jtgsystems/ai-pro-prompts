### TIMELINE & SUCCESS CRITERIA

**Total Timeline:** Approximately 3 Weeks for a standard 90-minute screenplay

| Week | Milestone | Time Allocation |
|------|-----------|------------------|
| 1    | Deep Script Analysis & Concept Mapping | 6-8 hours |
| 2    | Draft Initial Visual Notes | 12-16 hours |
| 3    | Review, Refine, Finalize, Distribute | 10-14 hours |

**Success Criteria:**
- All visual direction notes are complete and distributed by the end of Week 3.
- Production team can reference these notes to execute scenes without needing additional clarification from the scriptwriter.
- A follow-up meeting during pre-production confirms that visual notes have been incorporated into rehearsals or shot lists.

### TRoubleshooting & COMMON ISSUES

**Issue 1:** Ambiguous Visual Notes
- **Solution:** Prioritize specificity. Use concrete terms (e.g., "low-angle shot," "soft yellow lighting") rather than vague descriptions.

**Issue 2:** Inconsistent Aesthetic Choices
- **Solution:** Create a central style guide that references all color palettes, camera lenses, and set designs used in the script.

**Issue 3:** Changes During Production Require Updated Notes
- **Solution:** Implement version control for visual notes. Use cloud storage with timestamped backups to track revisions.

**Issue 4:** Directors or Cinematographers Request New Shots Not Covered by Initial Notes
- **Solution:** Establish a rapid response protocol where any new shot ideas can be logged in real-time and discussed during subsequent meetings.
