- **Success Criteria:** Capture first-contentful paint, time to interactive, overall score.

**STEP 2: Codebase Audit**
- **Action:** Review all JavaScript files for modern syntax usage, module imports, and potential inefficiencies.
- **Tools Needed:** VS Code, ESLint with Babel plugin.
- **Success Criteria:** Identify at least 3 areas needing optimization.

**STEP 3: Implement Bundling Optimization**
- **Action:** Configure webpack or Rollup to optimize output (tree shaking, minification).
- **Tools Needed:** Webpack Configurator, Terser for JS minification.
- **Success Criteria:** Bundle size reduced by 20%.

**STEP 4: Async/Await Refactoring**
- **Action:** Replace callback patterns with async/await syntax where applicable.
- **Tools Needed:** ESLint with `no-unused-vars` and `prefer-const`.
- **Success Criteria:** Codebase adheres to modern asynchronous patterns.

**STEP 5: Lazy Loading Implementation**
- **Action:** Apply dynamic imports for modules that are not critical on initial load.
- **Tools Needed:** React Dynamic Imports, webpack code splitting.
- **Success Criteria:** Load time improvement of at least 1 second.

**STEP 6: Code Splitting and Modularization**
- **Action:** Break down large JavaScript files into smaller chunks loaded on demand.
- **Tools Needed:** Webpack HMR, Babel for polyfills.
- **Success Criteria:** Page loads faster with modular code structure.

**STEP 7: Performance Monitoring Setup**
- **Action:** Integrate Lighthouse CI and WebPageTest API for continuous monitoring.
- **Tools Needed:** GitHub Actions, npm scripts.
- **Success Criteria:** Automated performance checks on every commit.

**STEP 8: Accessibility Review**
- **Action:** Run axe-core or WAVE tool to scan JavaScript implementations for accessibility issues.
- **Tools Needed:** Axe, WAVE.
- **Success Criteria:** No critical accessibility violations.

**STEP 9: Security Audit**
- **Action:** Conduct a CSP header review and XSS prevention check.
- **Tools Needed:** CSP Generator, HTML Validator.
- **Success Criteria:** All CSP headers correctly configured.

**STEP 10: Testing Framework Integration**
- **Action:** Set up Jest or Mocha for unit testing JavaScript modules.
- **Tools Needed:** Jest CLI, CI integration.
- **Success Criteria:** 80%+ test coverage with passing tests.

**STEP 11: Continuous Deployment Optimization**
- **Action:** Configure automated deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
- **Tools Needed:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI.
- **Success Criteria:** Deployments succeed without manual intervention.

## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

### Performance Metrics
Define how to measure success:

1. **Primary Metric:** First Contentful Paint < 2 seconds on mobile devices.
   - Target: ≤ 2000 ms
   - Measurement Method: Lighthouse CI and WebPageTest API.

2. **Secondary Metrics:**
   - Time to Interactive (TTI) < 5 seconds.
     - Target: ≤ 5000 ms
   - Total Page Size Reduction > 20%.
     - Target: ≤ initial size by 20%.

3. **Long-term Metrics:**
   - Maintain performance score ≥ 90 on Lighthouse.
   - Achieve consistent CI/CD success rate.

### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance against targets.
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities.
3. Implement changes iteratively.
4. Re-measure and validate improvements.
5. Repeat until all metrics are met.
