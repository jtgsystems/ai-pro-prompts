## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW  

### Step-by-Step Process  

**STEP 1: [Conduct User Research]**
- **Action:** Run mixed-method qualitative research (interviews, usability testing) to validate audience personas  
- **Tools Needed:** Zoom/Teams for remote interviews, Figma or Miro for prototyping mockups of docs navigation  
- **Success Criteria:** At least 8 user interviews completed with diverse technical backgrounds; initial persona draft approved by stakeholder  

**STEP 2: [Analyze Existing Documentation]**
- **Action:** Perform content inventory and readability analysis using automated tools (e.g., Pandoc, Hemingway)  
- **Tools Needed:** Pandoc for format consistency check, Hemingway Editor for Flesch-Kincaid scores, Excel for data visualization  
- **Success Criteria:** 85% of documents reviewed with readability score ≥70; inventory spreadsheet updated with version numbers and audience tags  

**STEP 3: [Map Content to Audience Needs]**
- **Action:** Create a content matrix linking each document section to specific user tasks/functions  
- **Tools Needed:** Lucidchart or Miro for visual mapping, Google Sheets for data tracking  
- **Success Criteria:** All major documentation pieces mapped with at least one primary audience need identified  

**STEP 4: [Identify Gaps and Opportunities]**
- **Action:** Use analytics dashboards to spot unmet user needs (e.g., high bounce rates on certain topics)  
- **Tools Needed:** Google Analytics, Mixpanel heatmaps, Dynatrace performance data  
- **Success Criteria:** Top 5 content gaps identified with proposed solutions; ROI of improvement prioritized
