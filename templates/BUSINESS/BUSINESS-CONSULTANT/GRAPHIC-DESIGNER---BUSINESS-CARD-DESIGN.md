## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

### Performance Metrics
Define how to measure success:

1. **Primary Metric:** Client satisfaction score (target >85% positive)
   - **Measurement Method:** Post-delivery survey using Google Forms with a 5-point scale.
   
2. **Secondary Metrics:**
   - **Print Quality Compliance:** All files pass color profile and bleed checks in Photoshop.
     - **Measurement Method:** Automated scripts checking CMYK range and margin settings.
   - **User Engagement:** Time taken to set up the final PDF on print machine.
     - **Measurement Method:** Log time spent by client or designer during production phase.

3. **Long-term Metrics:**
   - **Version Control Efficiency:** Number of revisions made post-delivery.
     - **Measurement Method:** Count of any follow-up requests or changes after delivery.
   - **Brand Consistency Score:** How well the final design aligns with brand guidelines over time.
     - **Measurement Method:** Quarterly review by brand manager.

### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. **Measure Current Performance** against established metrics.
2. **Identify Top 3 Improvement Opportunities**: Use feedback from client satisfaction survey and version control logs.
3. **Implement Changes**: Refine design based on identified gaps (e.g., adjust typography for better legibility).
4. **Re-measure**: After changes, re-assess the same metrics to confirm improvements.
