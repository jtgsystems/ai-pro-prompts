## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process

#### STEP 1: Initial Project Setup
- **Action:** Create a master project folder with subfolders for each phase of the editing process (e.g., Raw, In Edit, Final).
- **Tools Needed:** [File Explorer / Finder]
- **Success Criteria:** All initial folders exist and are accessible.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Forgetting to create final export folder.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour

#### STEP 2: Media Inventory
- **Action:** Catalog all existing footage using metadata extraction tools (e.g., Adobe Bridge, DaVinci Resolve).
- **Tools Needed:** [Adobe Bridge CC, DaVinci Resolve Studio]
- **Success Criteria:** All files are tagged with title, date, and category.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing timestamps or incorrect titles.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours

#### STEP 3: Folder Structure Implementation
- **Action:** Implement the folder structure defined in research based on project phases and media types.
- **Tools Needed:** [File Explorer / Finder]
- **Success Criteria:** All footage is placed within relevant folders with consistent naming conventions.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlapping or duplicate folders.
- **Time Estimate:** 8 hours

#### STEP 4: Backup Strategy
- **Action:** Set up automated backups using cloud storage (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive) and local NAS.
- **Tools Needed:** [Dropbox Business, Google Drive Enterprise]
- **Success Criteria:** All master footage is backed up to at least two locations with real-time sync enabled.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Failing to configure automatic sync or using only one backup method.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

#### STEP 5: Metadata Tagging
- **Action:** Use AI-powered tools like Adobe Media Encoder or DaVinci Resolve to automatically tag footage based on content and context.
- **Tools Needed:** [Adobe Media Encoder, DaVinci Resolve]
- **Success Criteria:** All files have relevant tags applied (e.g., scene type, date, location).
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking important metadata fields.
- **Time Estimate:** 6 hours

#### STEP 6: Accessibility Check
- **Action:** Verify all footage complies with accessibility standards by checking for closed captions and audio descriptions.
- **Tools Needed:** [Adobe Premiere Pro CC, DaVinci Resolve]
- **Success Criteria:** All accessible requirements are met (e.g., WCAG AA).
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing or poorly placed subtitles.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

#### STEP 7: Team Access and Permissions
- **Action:** Set up shared folders with appropriate permissions for team members to collaborate without compromising security.
- **Tools Needed:** [Google Drive Shared Drives, Dropbox Business]
- **Success Criteria:** Team can access all necessary footage but cannot modify or delete other users' files.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-permissioning leading to accidental changes or data loss.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour

#### STEP 8: Documentation and Training
- **Action:** Create a system documentation guide for future editors detailing folder structure, naming conventions, and backup procedures. Conduct a brief training session with team members.
- **Tools Needed:** [Google Docs, Confluence]
- **Success Criteria:** All team members are familiar with the organization system and can perform basic tasks independently.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Failing to update documentation after changes or only documenting steps for the initial setup.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

#### STEP 9: Quality Check
- **Action:** Perform a walkthrough of a sample edit to ensure all footage is easily accessible and correctly categorized.
- **Tools Needed:** [Adobe Premiere Pro CC]
- **Success Criteria:** Editor can complete tasks without errors or delays.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Finding missing files during the workflow which indicates incomplete organization.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours

#### STEP 10: Ongoing Maintenance Plan
- **Action:** Schedule regular audits (quarterly) to ensure continued adherence to organizational standards and update metadata as needed.
- **Tools Needed:** [Task Scheduler]
- **Success Criteria:** Quarterly reviews are completed without issues, and updates are documented.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Forgetting scheduled tasks or not documenting changes.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing

### Research Consolidation
After all sub-agents complete:
1. Synthesize findings into a unified strategy for the organization workflow.
2. Identify conflicts in best practices (e.g., cloud vs. local storage) and prioritize based on project needs.
3. Create a master action plan detailing each step with responsible parties.

## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

### Performance Metrics
Define how to measure success:

1. **Primary Metric:** % of footage correctly organized within the first 30 days  
   - Target: 100%  
   - Measurement Method: Automated count via metadata and folder structure validation scripts.

2. **Secondary Metrics:**  
   - Number of duplicated files identified during audits (Target: 0)  
   - Average time to locate a file for editing tasks (Target: <5 seconds)  

3. **Long-term Metrics:**  
   - Quarterly audit completion rate (Target: 100%)  
   - Employee satisfaction with organization system (NPS score target: >70)

### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance against targets at the end of each quarter.
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities from feedback and metrics.
3. Implement changes such as adjusting folder structure or backup frequency.
4. Re-measure to confirm improvements.
