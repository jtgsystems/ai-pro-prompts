#### Step 4: Deploy to Beta Platforms
**Action:** Push the beta build to TestFlight for iOS and Google Play Console Internal Testing for Android.
- **Tools Needed:** Firebase App Distribution (for internal testing), TestFlight
- **Success Criteria:** Build successfully deployed on both platforms without errors

#### Step 5: Monitor Crash Rates & Performance
**Action:** Use analytics tools like Firebase Crashlytics to monitor crash rates and performance metrics in real-time during beta.
- **Tools Needed:** Firebase Crashlytics, Sentry for error monitoring
- **Success Criteria:** Crash rate <5% over the first week of release

#### Step 6: Collect User Feedback & Ratings
**Action:** Implement in-app feedback mechanisms and encourage users to leave ratings on app stores.
- **Tools Needed:** InAppReview for prompting ratings, Firebase Remote Config for custom notifications
- **Success Criteria:** Average rating ≥4.5/5 by end of week

#### Step 7: Analyze Performance Metrics
**Action:** Use performance monitoring tools to analyze latency, response times, and other critical metrics.
- **Tools Needed:** New Relic, Datadog, Firebase Performance Monitoring
- **Success Criteria:** All metrics within acceptable ranges for user experience

#### Step 8: Iterate on Feedback & Bug Fixes
**Action:** Prioritize bug fixes based on crash reports and user feedback. Implement changes in a new build.
- **Tools Needed:** GitHub Issues, Jira tickets, Fastlane
- **Success Criteria:** Critical bugs resolved with no regression in functionality

#### Step 9: Conduct User Testing Sessions
**Action:** Organize remote testing sessions with beta users to validate feature acceptance and usability.
- **Tools Needed:** Zoom for video calls, Google Forms for feedback collection
- **Success Criteria:** Users successfully complete key tasks without issues

#### Step 10: Prepare for Public Release
**Action:** Ensure compliance with app store guidelines, finalize ASO strategy, prepare marketing materials.
- **Tools Needed:** SEMrush for keyword research, Hootsuite for social media scheduling
