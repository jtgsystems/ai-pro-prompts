- **Common Pitfalls:** Misclassification leading to delayed resolution.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours per day initially, tapering down as process stabilizes.

**STEP 3: Root Cause Analysis**
- **Action:** Conduct a structured analysis to identify underlying causes of issues.
- **Tools Needed:** Fishbone Diagram software (Miro or Lucidchart), Confluence for documentation.
- **Success Criteria:** Root cause identified and documented within 48 hours.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Focusing on symptoms rather than root causes.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 days average per issue.

**STEP 4: Solution Development**
- **Action:** Propose corrective actions based on root cause analysis. Engage stakeholders for validation.
- **Tools Needed:** Brainstorming sessions via Zoom, document collaboration in Confluence.
- **Success Criteria:** Solutions approved by project team and aligned with project goals.

**STEP 5: Implementation**
- **Action:** Execute corrective actions, monitor progress daily.
- **Tools Needed:** Project Management Software (MS Project), Status Update Slack Channels.
- **Success Criteria:** Solutions implemented and validated within the project timeline.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Delays in implementation due to resource constraints or miscommunication.
- **Time Estimate:** Implementation varies per solution but ideally completed within 1 week.

**STEP 6: Follow-Up Review**
- **Action:** Conduct a post-mortem review to assess resolution effectiveness and document lessons learned.
- **Tools Needed:** Confluence for documenting reviews, Post-Mortem templates in Google Docs.
- **Success Criteria:** All follow-up actions logged and assigned within 5 days of implementation completion.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Failure to conduct thorough reviews leading to recurring issues.
- **Time Estimate:** Immediate post-resolution.

**STEP 7: Continuous Improvement**
- **Action:** Update issue management processes based on review findings. Train team members on best practices.
- **Tools Needed:** Training sessions via Zoom, updated documentation in Confluence.
- **Success Criteria:** Training completion rate ≥90% and process update frequency at least quarterly.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring feedback leading to stagnation of processes.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing effort.
