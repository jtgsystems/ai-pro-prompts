- **Time Estimate:** 8 hours

#### Step 5: [Testing Phase]
- **Action:** Conduct unit, integration, and end-to-end tests covering all app functionalities, including edge cases (e.g., high traffic scenarios).
- **Tools Needed:** Jest/Rails testing framework for backend logic; Cypress or Selenium for frontend testing.
- **Success Criteria:** All automated tests pass with 100% coverage; manual QA confirms no critical bugs in production-like environments.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incomplete test suites missing key user flows leading to undetected issues post-deployment.
- **Time Estimate:** 6 hours

#### Step 6: [Deployment Preparation]
- **Action:** Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI for automated testing and deployment processes.
- **Tools Needed:** GitHub/GitLab repository, Docker images for app deployment; Heroku or Railway for hosting.
- **Success Criteria:** Successful build and deploy to staging environment passes all tests and is ready for review by store owners.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Environment mismatch causing failed builds in production pipelines; missing security scans leading to vulnerabilities.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours

#### Step 7: [Staging Deployment & Review]
