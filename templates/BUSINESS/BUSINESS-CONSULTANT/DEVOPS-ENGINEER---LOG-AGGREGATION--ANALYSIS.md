**Tools:** Prometheus for monitoring, Grafana for visualization
**Success Criteria:** Documented baseline metrics with 95% confidence intervals

#### Step 2: Choose Centralized Logging Platform (1 week)
**Action:** Evaluate ELK Stack vs Splunk based on:
- Cost of implementation and licensing
- Ease of integration with existing systems
- Community support and documentation quality
**Tools:** Elastic Cloud Edition, Splunk Universal Forwarder
**Success Criteria:** Selected platform meets all technical requirements and budget constraints

#### Step 3: Implement Log Collection Agents (2 weeks)
**Action:** Install agents on servers, containers, and cloud services.
- Configure log forwarding to central repository using TLS encryption
- Set up health checks for agent connectivity and reliability
**Tools:** Filebeat or Fluentd for container environments; SolarWinds Agent for VMs
**Success Criteria:** 99% of logs successfully collected without data loss

#### Step 4: Define Log Analysis Use Cases (1 week)
**Action:** Create index patterns, queries, and dashboards based on:
- Operational metrics (e.g., request latency, error rates)
- Security alerts (e.g., brute force attempts, suspicious IPs)
- Compliance reporting requirements
**Tools:** Kibana for UI configuration; Elasticsearch DSL for query writing
**Success Criteria:** At least 5 actionable insights visualized in dashboards

#### Step 5: Set Up Alerting Mechanisms (1 week)
**Action:** Configure alerts based on:
- Anomalies in log patterns
- Threshold breaches (e.g., error count, latency spikes)
- Specific security events (e.g., DDoS attempts)
**Tools:** Kibana alerting; Splunk saved searches
**Success Criteria:** 100% of critical alerts trigger correctly during test scenarios

#### Step 6: Implement Data Retention Policies (1 week)
**Action:** Configure storage tiers based on log age:
- Hot data stored in SSD for 7 days
- Warm data moved to HDD for 30 days
- Cold data archived to cloud or tape for long-term retention
**Tools:** Elasticsearch lifecycle policies; Splunk indexer clustering
**Success Criteria:** Data access times meet operational requirements

#### Step 7: Automate Incident Response Playbooks (2 weeks)
**Action:** Develop playbooks for common issues:
- Application crashes with stack traces
- Authentication failures across services
- Resource exhaustion events
**Tools:** Ansible roles or Terraform modules for automation
**Success Criteria:** Automated response reduces first responder time by 50%

#### Step 8: Conduct Security Review (1 week)
**Action:** Validate that sensitive data is properly masked.
- Ensure compliance with privacy laws in log retention and sharing
- Implement role-based access controls on logging platform
**Tools:** OpenSCAP for configuration compliance; HashiCorp Vault for secrets management
**Success Criteria:** No critical security findings during review

#### Step 9: Optimize Query Performance (1 week)
**Action:** Identify slow queries affecting dashboard load times.
- Tune index configurations based on query patterns
- Implement caching mechanisms where applicable
**Tools:** Elasticsearch explain API; Kibana performance profiler
**Success Criteria:** All dashboards render within 2 seconds

#### Step 10: Disaster Recovery Plan (1 week)
**Action:** Develop DR procedures for logging platform:
- Regular snapshots of log repositories
- Failover capabilities to secondary data center or cloud region
- Backup verification and testing schedule
**Tools:** Rclone for cross-region backups; AWS Backup policies
**Success Criteria:** Tested failover process restores 99% of logs within defined RTO

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Logs Missing from Dashboard**
   - Verify agent health status
   - Check if forwarder is sending data to the correct index pattern
   - Ensure no disk space issues on nodes

2. **Alerts Not Triggering**
   - Confirm alert query logic matches expected threshold conditions
   - Check that alerts are configured with proper notification channels
   - Inspect alert history for missed executions or timeouts

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - Review Elasticsearch node resource utilization (CPU, memory)
   - Investigate slow queries using explain API output
   - Consider increasing shard count if data volume grows

4. **Security Breach Detected**
   - Identify compromised systems by analyzing access patterns
   - Rotate credentials immediately and revoke existing ones
