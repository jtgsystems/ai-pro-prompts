- **Common Pitfalls:** Forgetting to initialize the repo in the correct location; missing permissions setup.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour

**STEP 2: [Initial Implementation]**
- **Action:** Create a basic component skeleton (e.g., Button, Input).
- **Tools Needed:** Visual Studio Code, Figma for design mockups.
- **Success Criteria:** At least three components are coded and tested locally.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not following naming conventions; missing accessibility attributes.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 3: [Core Work]**
- **Action:** Build out the full component library with all necessary UI elements (e.g., forms, modals).
- **Tools Needed:** Storybook for developing components in isolation, Jest for testing.

**STEP 4: [Documentation & Storybook Setup]**
- **Action:** Set up a Storybook instance for each component library.
- **Tools Needed:** Storybook, Markdown editors (e.g., Notion).
- **Success Criteria:** Each component has its own story file with variations and usage examples.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inconsistent formatting; missing alt text or descriptions for components.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 5: [Testing & Validation]**
- **Action:** Implement automated tests (unit, integration) for all components.
- **Tools Needed:** Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress for end-to-end testing.
- **Success Criteria:** All tests pass without failures; test coverage is above 80%.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not running the full suite before merging; ignoring flaky tests.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 6: [Performance Optimization]**

- **Tools Needed:** webpack, Rollup, PurgeCSS for CSS optimization.
- **Success Criteria:** Bundle size reduced by at least 20% compared to initial build; load times improved.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking unused imports; forgetting to run production builds.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 7: [Accessibility Review]**
- **Action:** Conduct an accessibility audit of all components.
- **Tools Needed:** Axe, Lighthouse for automated checks; manual testing with screen readers.
- **Success Criteria:** All components pass WCAG AA standards without exceptions.

- **Tools Needed:** GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Jenkins.
- **Success Criteria:** Pushing to main branch automatically triggers tests and deploys the component library to a staging environment.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrectly mapping branches; not testing deployment in production-like environments.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 9: [Version Control & Branch Strategy]**
- **Action:** Establish a clear branching strategy (e.g., feature, develop, master).
- **Tools Needed:** Git hooks for enforcing commit messages and code reviews.
- **Success Criteria:** All changes are reviewed before merging to the main branch; no merge conflicts in recent history.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Forgetting to update documentation when switching branches; not using pull requests effectively.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 10: [Deployment & Release]**
- **Action:** Publish the component library to a public package registry (e.g., npm, Yarn).
- **Tools Needed:** npm, Yarn, GitHub Pages for hosting documentation.
- **Success Criteria:** The package is listed on npm/yarn; all dependencies are resolved and installed without errors.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking private packages or authentication issues with the registry; not versioning properly.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 11: [Maintenance Plan]**
- **Action:** Create a maintenance plan for ongoing updates to the component library.
- **Tools Needed:** Project management tools (e.g., Trello, Asana), Slack notifications for breaking changes.
