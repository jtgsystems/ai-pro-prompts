### Measurable Success Criteria for Conversion-Optimized Landing Page

1. Increase in conversion rate compared to baseline or competitor pages
2. Reduction in bounce rate and time on page
3. Higher engagement metrics such as click-through rates (CTRs) and form submissions
4. Improved search engine rankings for targeted keywords related to the landing page's offer
5. Enhanced user satisfaction scores through surveys, net promoter scores (NPS), or usability testing
6. Increased revenue per visitor (RPV) or average order value (AOV)
7. Reduction in customer acquisition costs (CAC) due to optimized targeting and messaging

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Responsive Design Breakpoints**
   - Ensure all critical content remains visible across different screen sizes
   - Test on real devices using cloud-based testing services like BrowserStack or Sauce Labs

2. **High Bounce Rates**
   - Review analytics data to identify pages with high exit rates or low engagement metrics
   - Analyze user behavior patterns and adjust landing page elements accordingly (e.g., headlines, CTAs)

3. **Slow Page Load Times**
   - Conduct performance audits using tools like Google Pagespeed Insights or Lighthouse
   - Optimize images, minify code, and leverage caching techniques to reduce load times

4. **Form Abandonment Rates**
   - Identify friction points in the form submission process (e.g., length of fields, error messages)
   - Simplify forms by reducing field count or providing helpful tooltips/feedback
   - Implement progress indicators or micro-interactions to guide users through the form

5. **A/B Testing Insights Not Driving Action**
