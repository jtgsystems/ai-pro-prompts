### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Alerts Not Triggering**
   - Verify alert rules are correctly defined in Prometheus.
   - Check that the time range for evaluation matches your service availability requirements.
   - Ensure Alertmanager is configured to route alerts to the correct notification channel (e.g., PagerDuty).

2. **Metrics Missing or Incorrect**
   - Confirm exporters are running and forwarding metrics to Prometheus.
   - Inspect logs in Elasticsearch/Logstash for any errors related to metric collection.

3. **Dashboard Not Updating**
   - Check Grafana connection settings to ensure it's pointing at the correct Prometheus endpoint.
   - Verify data source permissions and that the latest configuration is saved.

4. **High False Positive Rate**
   - Review alert thresholds and adjust them based on historical metrics.
   - Implement suppression rules for known false positives during scheduled maintenance windows.

### Recommended Tool Stack (2025)

- **Primary Tools:**
  - Prometheus + Alertmanager (free)

**Week 3:** Integrate log aggregation using ELK stack to correlate logs with metrics and detect anomalies.

**Week 4-5:** Configure alerting systems based on defined SLOs and SLIs. Set up notification channels like Slack, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie.

**Week 6:** Create comprehensive dashboards for real-time visibility into application health, system performance, and user behavior.

**Week 7-8:** Conduct load testing and chaos engineering exercises to validate alert thresholds and response times.

**Week 9:** Fine-tune alerts based on test results. Optimize dashboard layouts for clarity and actionable insights.

**Week 10+:** Document the entire process including monitoring architecture, metrics definitions, alert policies, and escalation procedures. Train the team on effective use of dashboards and incident response workflows.

By following this structured approach, a DevOps Engineer can establish an effective Monitoring & Alerting System that ensures high availability, quick detection of issues, and efficient resolution, thereby achieving the ultimate goal defined for 2025.
