   - Measurement Method: Compare pre- and post-assessment scores.

2. **Secondary Metrics:**
   - Average Time Spent on Tasks (to ensure pacing is appropriate).
   - Engagement Rates (completion of differentiated activities).
   - Feedback Satisfaction Scores from Students and Parents.

3. **Long-term Metrics:**
   - Year-over-Year Growth in Student Achievement.
