## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: [Foundation Setup]**
- **Action:** Develop a Customer Health Score model using a weighted scoring system (e.g., NPS, usage frequency, support tickets).
- **Tools Needed:** Excel/Google Sheets for modeling, Python/pandas for data manipulation.
- **Success Criteria:** Model passes validation with at least 85% predictive accuracy on historical churn.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-reliance on a single metric; lack of real-time updates.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 weeks

**STEP 2: [Initial Implementation]**
- **Action:** Integrate model into CRM and customer portal dashboards.
- **Tools Needed:** Salesforce/Azure Customer Health Platform, custom dashboard widgets.
- **Success Criteria:** Dashboard displays health score per account with real-time updates.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Data latency; user resistance to new interface.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 3: [Core Work]**
- **Action:** Train customer success teams on using the health score for proactive engagement.
- **Tools Needed:** Training videos, interactive webinars in Zoom or Teams.
- **Success Criteria:** Agents score above 80% correct when identifying high-risk accounts during mock scenarios.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inconsistent application of scoring across teams; lack of regular review sessions.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing

**STEP 4: [Advanced Analytics]**
- **Action:** Implement AI-driven alerts for customers moving into risk zones (e.g., sudden drop in usage).
- **Tools Needed:** Azure Machine Learning, AWS Lambda functions for real-time triggers.
- **Success Criteria:** Alerts trigger with <5% false positives and result in improved health scores within 30 days.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Alert fatigue; insufficient thresholds leading to unnecessary interventions.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 weeks

**STEP 5: [Customer Engagement]**
- **Action:** Develop proactive engagement workflows based on health score tiers (e.g., high-risk customers receive scheduled calls).
- **Tools Needed:** Calendly or Zoom for scheduling, automated email templates in Mailchimp.
- **Success Criteria:** Engagement rate increases by 15% among targeted accounts.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inadequate resource allocation; insufficient follow-up steps.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 6: [Continuous Improvement Loop]**
- **Action:** Regularly review health score model accuracy and adjust weights based on feedback.
- **Tools Needed:** RAG (Red/Amber/Green) status dashboards in Power BI, A/B testing platforms.
- **Success Criteria:** Model accuracy improves by at least 5% each quarter; engagement metrics remain stable or improve.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Stagnation of model without updates; lack of stakeholder buy-in for changes.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing

**STEP 7: [Optimization]**
- **Action:** Use A/B testing to refine customer journey paths and communication cadence based on health score tiers.

- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of executive interest; overly complex data visualizations.
- **Time Estimate:** Weekly

**STEP 9: [Training & Knowledge Transfer]**
- **Action:** Conduct quarterly knowledge sessions to update agents on model changes or new features.
- **Tools Needed:** LMS platforms like Moodle, recorded training videos in Vimeo.
- **Success Criteria:** Training completion rate >90%; post-training quiz scores >80%.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inconsistent delivery; lack of follow-up exercises.
- **Time Estimate:** Quarterly

**STEP 10: [Compliance & Security Review]**
- **Action:** Regularly audit the health score system for GDPR/CCPA compliance and data security best practices.
