**STEP 5: Iterative Design Updates**
- **Action:** Based on test findings, update designs in Figma/Adobe XD.
- **Tools Needed:** [Figma, Adobe XD]
- **Success Criteria:** Re-test updated design; ensure critical usability issues resolved by >80% of participants.

**STEP 6: Accessibility Audit**
- **Action:** Perform automated accessibility checks using Wave or Lighthouse.
- **Tools Needed:** [Wave, Lighthouse (Chrome DevTools)]
- **Success Criteria:** Fix all high/medium priority WCAG violations. Pass automated accessibility audit with no errors.

**STEP 7: Visual Design Implementation**
- **Action:** Create visual components in Figma following brand guidelines.
- **Tools Needed:** [Figma]
- **Success Criteria:** Ensure color contrast ratios meet AA standards; all typography adheres to specified hierarchy.

**STEP 8: Collaboration & Handoff**
- **Action:** Share designs with developers using InVision or Zeplin for handoff.
- **Tools Needed:** [InVision, Zeplin]
- **Success Criteria:** Developers can implement design without major discrepancies. Conduct final QA before launch.

**STEP 9: Post-Launch Monitoring**
- **Action:** Set up analytics tracking (Google Analytics, Mixpanel) and feedback channels (user reviews).
- **Tools Needed:** [Google Analytics, Mixpanel]
- **Success Criteria:** Monitor key metrics weekly; initiate bug fixes or improvements based on data trends.

### Tools & Software

**Primary Tool (free):**
- **Figma (free tier for individual use)**: For collaborative design prototyping and handoff.
  - *Alternative:* Adobe XD (free trial available)

**Core Feature Comparison:**

| Feature | Figma | Sketch |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Collaboration | Real-time co-editing with multiple users | Limited real-time collaboration |
| Prototyping | Advanced interactions, triggers, and state management | Basic prototyping capabilities |
| Plugin Ecosystem | Extensive selection (e.g., for motion design) | Fewer plugins available |
| Accessibility Tools | Built-in color contrast checker & export options | Requires external tools |

**Paid Alternative:**
- **Adobe XD Pro ($25/month)**: For teams with extensive UI/UX workflow needs.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Stakeholder Misalignment**
   - Issue: Stakeholders provide conflicting feedback during reviews.
   - Solution: Document all inputs; prioritize based on business goals and user impact.

2. **Design Not Translatable to Code**
   - Issue: Visual elements or interactions can't be accurately implemented by developers.
   - Solution: Use Figma's built-in handoff features (auto-generated code snippets) before development.

3. **User Testing Fatigue**
   - Issue: Users provide repetitive feedback during testing sessions.
   - Solution: Rotate participant groups; incorporate both new and existing users in sessions.

4. **Accessibility Gaps**
   - Issue: Design fails to meet WCAG standards upon audit.
   - Solution: Use automated tools (Wave, Lighthouse) plus manual review with accessibility experts.

5. **Project Scope Creep**
   - Issue: Unplanned features or changes during iterations impact timeline and resources.
   - Solution: Establish a change management process; use version control for design assets.
