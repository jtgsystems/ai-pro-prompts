**STEP 5: [Approval Workflow Configuration]**
- **Action:** Set up automated approval workflows for transactions above a certain threshold. Ensure each step requires digital signatures and timestamps.
- **Tools Needed:** Airtable (free), Approval Desk
- **Success Criteria:** All high-value transactions are approved according to policy with complete documentation in the audit trail.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Manual overrides not documented, insufficient approver oversight.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 6: [Regular Monitoring & Alerting]**
- **Action:** Implement real-time monitoring of transaction activities and access patterns. Set up alerts for unusual activity that could indicate fraud or data breaches.
- **Tools Needed:** Splunk Enterprise Security Suite (free tier), AWS CloudWatch
- **Success Criteria:** System detects and logs 99% of anomalous transactions, and all alerts are resolved within the set SLA.
- **Common Pitfalls:** False positives overwhelming administrators, monitoring not configured for critical systems.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing with initial configuration in 2 weeks

**STEP 7: [Compliance Audits & Reporting]**
- **Action:** Conduct regular compliance audits against regulatory requirements. Generate periodic audit trail reports demonstrating adherence to best practices.
- **Tools Needed:** Compliance Audit Checklist (free), Tableau Server
- **Success Criteria:** All internal and external audits pass without critical findings, reports are delivered on schedule.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing documentation, outdated reporting standards not followed.
