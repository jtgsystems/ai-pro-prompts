- **Tools Needed:** Notion (free), Evernote (optional).
- **Success Criteria:** Draft passes initial internal review without flagged objections.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Confusing structure or lack of urgency in CTA.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours

**STEP 4: [Peer Review]**
- **Action:** Share draft with a peer for feedback on objection handling.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma (free), Slack (optional).
- **Success Criteria:** Peer review receives ≥4/5 positive rating and ≤2 suggested changes.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-reliance on one reviewer or ignoring critical feedback.
