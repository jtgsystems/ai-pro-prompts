### Execution Steps

1. **Define Learning Objectives**
   - Identify key concepts, skills and competencies to be taught
   - Ensure alignment with curriculum standards 
   - Write clear, measurable learning objectives (e.g., "Students will be able to...")

2. **Select Content & Resources**
   - Determine core content topics for the lesson/unit
   - Gather relevant materials: textbooks, articles, videos, interactive simulations, etc.
   - Curate online resources using a tool like Flipboard or Pinterest

3. **Design Instructional Activities**
   - Plan engaging activities that promote active learning (e.g., discussions, labs, projects)
   - Incorporate differentiated instruction to meet diverse student needs
   - Integrate technology tools for interactive experiences 
   - Examples: Google Docs for collaborative writing, Kahoot! for quizzes

4. **Plan Assessments & Feedback**
   - Design formative assessments like exit tickets or quick quizzes
   - Create summative assessments aligned with learning objectives (e.g., tests, essays)
   - Develop rubrics for clear grading criteria 
   - Plan data-driven instruction based on assessment results

5. **Create a Detailed Lesson Outline**
   - Organize lesson into an introduction, main activities and conclusion
   - Allocate time for each segment of the lesson plan
   - Include any necessary materials or technology needed

6. **Differentiate Instruction**
   - Identify different learning styles/preferences in your classroom
   - Adapt content, process & products to meet diverse student needs
   - Provide multiple pathways for students to demonstrate mastery

7. **Incorporate Technology Tools**
   - Select appropriate tech tools that support the lesson objectives
   - Examples: Google Classroom for assignment distribution and grading,
                 Nearpod for interactive lessons, Padlet for collaborative brainstorming
   - Ensure all student devices have necessary permissions/access

8. **Establish Clear Expectations & Procedures** 
   - Outline class rules and procedures at the beginning of each term
   - Provide a visual schedule with timers to keep students on track
   - Model appropriate behavior during transitions between activities

9. **Collaborate with Colleagues**
   - Consult with other teachers for feedback on lesson plans
   - Participate in grade-level or department meetings for professional growth
   - Join online teacher communities like Twitter PLN (Professional Learning Network)

10. **Reflect & Iterate**
    - After each lesson, reflect on what went well and areas for improvement
    - Document insights in a reflective journal or using an app like Seesaw
    - Revise future lessons based on this reflection
