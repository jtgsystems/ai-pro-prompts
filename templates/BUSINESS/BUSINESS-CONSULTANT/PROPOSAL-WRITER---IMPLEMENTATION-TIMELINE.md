## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

### Performance Metrics
Define how to measure success:

1. **Primary Metric:**  
   - **Metric:** Percentage of tasks completed on time compared to the planned timeline.  
   - **Target:** 90% or higher adherence rate.  
   - **Measurement Method:** Weekly dashboard tracking task completion vs scheduled dates.

2. **Secondary Metrics:**  
   - Task Overruns: Measure instances where tasks exceed their allocated time by >10%.  
   - Stakeholder Satisfaction: Survey score of stakeholder satisfaction with the timeline's clarity and feasibility.  

3. **Long-term Metrics:**  
   - Project Delivery Rate: Percentage of projects delivered within budget and on schedule over 6 months.

### Iterative Improvement Loop
