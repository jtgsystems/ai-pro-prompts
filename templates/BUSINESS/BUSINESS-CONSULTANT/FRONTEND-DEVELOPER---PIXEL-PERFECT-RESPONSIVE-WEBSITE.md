### Troubleshooting Common Issues
**Issue 1:** CSS Breakpoints Not Applied Correctly
- **Cause:** Media queries not defined in all component styles.
- **Solution:** Ensure breakpoints are applied consistently using a CSS framework or custom variables.

**Issue 2:** JavaScript Errors on Production Build
- **Cause:** Missing polyfills for older browsers, or incorrect build configuration.
- **Solution:** Use Babel to transpile code and ensure polyfills are included in production bundle.

**Issue 3:** Accessibility Violations Detected**
- **Cause:** Incorrect use of ARIA roles, missing alt text on images.
- **Solution:** Run automated accessibility scans (e.g., AXE) and fix issues manually where necessary.

**Issue 4:** Performance Degradation After Adding New Features
- **Cause:** Large image assets or heavy third-party scripts causing slow load times.
- **Solution:** Optimize resources, lazy-load images, and minimize bundle size using tools like Webpack.
