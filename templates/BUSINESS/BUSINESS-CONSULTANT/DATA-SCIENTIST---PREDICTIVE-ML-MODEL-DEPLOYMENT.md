- **Tools Needed:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Success Criteria:** Cleaned and preprocessed dataset ready for modeling.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not checking for skewed distributions or outliers.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours.

**STEP 3: [Model Development]**
- **Action:** Split data into training/validation/test sets. Experiment with multiple algorithms, tune hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
- **Tools Needed:** Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM.
- **Success Criteria:** Model achieves >90% accuracy on validation set.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overfitting due to insufficient data or improper cross-validation.
- **Time Estimate:** 8 hours.

**STEP 4: [Model Evaluation and Refinement]**
- **Action:** Evaluate model using F1 score, AUC, confusion matrix. Retrain with refined features.
- **Tools Needed:** Scikit-learn metrics module.
- **Success Criteria:** Final model meets >90% accuracy and <1% error rate criteria.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not validating on unseen data or skipping edge cases.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours.

**STEP 5: [Containerization]**
- **Action:** Package the trained model into a Docker container, include all dependencies in requirements.txt.
- **Tools Needed:** Dockerfile, pip freeze.
- **Success Criteria:** Container builds successfully and runs locally with test data.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing package versions or environment inconsistencies.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours.

**STEP 6: [Deployment Preparation]**
- **Action:** Set up CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or Jenkins. Configure automated testing for model updates.
- **Tools Needed:** GitHub Actions/Jenkins, Docker Registry, API Gateway (optional).
- **Success Criteria:** Pipeline triggers successfully with no errors on code push.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect branch protection rules or missing environment variables.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours.

**STEP 7: [Model Deployment]**
- **Action:** Push container to registry and deploy via API Gateway. Configure endpoint health checks.
- **Tools Needed:** AWS SageMaker, Google Cloud AI Platform, Azure ML.
- **Success Criteria:** Model accessible at a stable URL with <1% error rate in production.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Misconfigured endpoints or not handling batch requests properly.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours.

**STEP 8: [Monitoring and Maintenance]**
- **Action:** Set up logging using CloudWatch/Azure Monitor. Schedule periodic retraining based on data drift detection.
