### 2. Execution Steps with Specific Actions

1. **Inventory All Servers**:
   - Use tools like Ansible or PowerShell to generate an inventory list of all servers and their configurations.
   
2. **Update Package Repositories**:
   - Run `apt update` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `yum check-update` (CentOS/RHEL) for package management.

3. **Apply Critical Security Patches**:
   - Utilize tools like Unattended Upgrades on Debian-based systems to automatically install security patches.
   
4. **Regularly Backup Data**:
   - Implement automated backup solutions using tools like Bacula or Duplicati, ensuring data is backed up to a secure offsite location.

5. **Monitor System Performance**:
   - Deploy monitoring agents such as Prometheus and Grafana for real-time performance metrics.
   
6. **Document All Changes**:
   - Keep detailed logs of all changes made using tools like Git for version control of configuration files.

7. **Automate Routine Maintenance Tasks**:
   - Write scripts in Bash or Python to automate tasks like cleaning up old logs, resizing partitions, and restarting services if necessary.

8. **Conduct Periodic Security Audits**:
   - Use Nmap scans (free) or Nessus (premium) for vulnerability assessments.

9. **Review Logs Regularly**:
   - Centralize logs using ELK Stack and set up alerts for unusual activities.

10. **Plan for Disaster Recovery**:
    - Test backup restoration procedures monthly to ensure data recoverability.

### 3. Tools, Software, and Platforms Used

- **Operating Systems**: Ubuntu Server (Linux), Windows Server.
- **Virtualization & Cloud Services**: VMware Workstation Pro (free trial), Amazon Web Services (AWS) - Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).
- **Backup Solutions**: Bacula, Duplicati.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Prometheus + Grafana, Nagios XI (free version), Zabbix.
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized log management and analysis.
- **Automation & Scripting**: Ansible, Python 3.x, PowerShell Core.
- **Security Management**: Unattended Upgrades, Fail2Ban for firewall rules.

### 4. Measurable Success Criteria

1. **Patching Compliance**:
   - All servers are updated with the latest security patches within a defined period (e.g., 30 days).
   
2. **Backup Verification**:
   - Successful restore of backup data is verified monthly.
   
3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - System performance metrics meet predefined thresholds without exceeding resource limits.

4. **Incident Resolution Time**:
   - Average time to resolve critical incidents should be under a specified threshold (e.g., 2 hours).

5. **Security Audit Results**:
   - Zero high-severity vulnerabilities identified after regular security audits.
   
6. **Backup Success Rate**:
   - All scheduled backups are completed successfully without failures.

### 5. Troubleshooting Section

#### Common Issues & Solutions

1. **Failed Package Installation**:
   - Check repository configuration and ensure network connectivity.
   - Use `apt list --upgradable` or `yum list updates` to identify available packages.

2. **Backup Failure**:
   - Verify storage space availability, check script logs for errors, ensure the backup service is running.

3. **Performance Degradation**:
   - Monitor CPU and memory usage; optimize resource allocation if necessary.
   - Check for background processes that might be consuming excessive resources.

4. **Security Alerts**:
   - Investigate alerts from monitoring tools to identify potential security breaches or misconfigurations.

### 6. Recommended Tool Stack with Pricing

- **Primary Tools (Free/Open Source)**
  - Ansible: Free
  - Prometheus + Grafana: Free
  - ELK Stack: Free
  - Bacula: Free

- **Alternative/Optional Paid Tools**
