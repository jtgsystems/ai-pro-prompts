2. **Front-End Development**
   - Scaffold a React/Angular/Vue application using `create-react-app`, `angular/cli`, or `vue-cli`.
   - Structure components, routes, and state management (Redux/MobX/Vuex).

3. **Back-End Development**
   - Set up the back-end server with Node.js + Express.js.
   - Implement RESTful APIs following OpenAPI/Swagger specifications.

4. **Database Integration**
   - Choose between SQL or NoSQL databases based on project needs.
   - Use Sequelize/TypeORM for SQL or Mongoose/MongoDB driver for NoSQL.

5. **Containerization with Docker**
   - Write a `Dockerfile` to define the application environment.
   - Build and push Docker images to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub).

6. **Orchestration with Kubernetes**
   - Define Kubernetes manifests (Deployments, Services) for scaling and load balancing.

7. **Serverless Functions**
   - Package your back-end logic into serverless functions if applicable.
   - Deploy using AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions.

8. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
   - Use GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to automate testing, building, and deployment.
   - Define Terraform scripts for infrastructure provisioning.

9. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Set up Prometheus/Grafana for metrics monitoring.
   - Implement ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

10. **Testing Strategy Implementation**
    - Write unit tests using Jest/Mocha or Jasmine.
    - Automate end-to-end testing with Cypress or Puppeteer.

11. **Security Hardening**
    - Enforce HTTPS on the front-end and back-end.
    - Implement API rate limiting and authentication using JWT/OAuth2.

12. **Documentation & Code Reviews**
    - Document APIs using Swagger/OpenAPI.
    - Conduct peer code reviews to ensure best practices are followed.

13. **Deploy to Cloud Platform**
    - Choose a cloud provider (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure).
    - Deploy the application using Cloud Run or App Engine.

14. **Monitoring and Incident Response**
    - Set up alerts for critical metrics (CPU, memory usage).
    - Establish an incident response plan for handling outages.

15. **Optimization & Scaling**
    - Profile the application to identify bottlenecks.
    - Scale horizontally across multiple instances in Kubernetes or Cloud Functions.
