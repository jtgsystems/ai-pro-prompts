## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: [Dataset Profiling]**
- **Action:** Profile each dataset using Pandas or Great Expectations
- **Tools Needed:** Python (pandas, great_expectations), Data catalog tool (Confluence)
- **Success Criteria:** All datasets have a profiling report with completeness and quality metrics
- **Common Pitfalls:** Skipping critical fields like transaction dates
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour per dataset

**STEP 2: [Automated Validation Rule Setup]**
- **Action:** Define validation rules using Great Expectations or dbt tests
- **Tools Needed:** Python, Great Expectations CLI, dbt project structure
- **Success Criteria:** All critical fields have at least one pass/fail expectation
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overly complex rule sets leading to false positives/negatives
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours for initial setup

**STEP 3: [Data Cleansing Implementation]**
- **Action:** Apply cleansing scripts across datasets (e.g., standardizing currencies, removing duplicates)
- **Tools Needed:** Python scripts in Git repo, DVC or version control integration
- **Success Criteria:** No critical data anomalies remain after cleanse
- **Common Pitfalls:** Data loss due to incorrect deduplication logic
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days for large datasets

**STEP 4: [Version Control and Lineage Setup]**
- **Action:** Add all scripts, schemas, and dashboards to Git; link them in the data lineage tool
