- **Tools Needed:** React Native or Flutter SDK, Xcode (iOS), Android Studio (Android).
- **Success Criteria:** Notifications can be successfully sent from the backend to both platforms without errors.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrectly handling token refreshes or failing to validate server signatures.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours

#### Step 3: Handle User Preferences
- **Action:** Build UI components for users to opt-in/opt-out of push notifications and manage notification settings.
- **Tools Needed:** React Native/Flutter for mobile app, Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Success Criteria:** Changes in user preferences are reflected immediately on both the client side and backend server.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Failing to persist user choices or syncing preferences across sessions.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

#### Step 4: Define Notification Content Structure
- **Action:** Create a JSON schema for all notification payloads including fields like message ID, priority level, expiration time, etc.
- **Tools Needed:** Any text editor (VS Code).
- **Success Criteria:** All components of the app can generate and validate notifications against the defined schema.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing mandatory fields or incorrect data types leading to validation failures.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour

#### Step 5: Implement Security Measures
- **Action:** Secure all API endpoints using HTTPS, implement JWT for authentication, and encrypt sensitive user data in databases.
- **Tools Needed:** OpenSSL, dotenv package for managing secrets.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Issue 1: Notifications Not Delivering
- **Possible Causes:** Token invalid/expired, incorrect server key, firewall rules blocking traffic.
- **Solutions:** Verify token integrity using Firebase console, re-authenticate with correct API keys, check cloud function timeouts.

#### Issue 2: High Failure Rate of Notifications
- **Possible Causes:** Server misconfiguration, network throttling, data payload size exceeds limits.
- **Solutions:** Review backend logs for specific error messages, optimize payload sizes, implement exponential backoff in retries.

#### Issue 3: User Opt-Out Not Propagating
- **Possible Causes:** Race condition between UI update and server persistence, database write failures.
- **Solutions:** Use atomic operations to ensure consistency across client and server state changes, implement fallback mechanisms for failed writes.

#### Issue 4: Compliance Violations
- **Possible Causes:** Lack of user consent or data storage practices violating GDPR/CCPA.
- **Solutions:** Implement explicit opt-in dialogs, store personal identifiers securely with encryption at rest/in transit, provide clear privacy policies within the app.
