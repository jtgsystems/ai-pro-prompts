- **Tools Needed:** Python (pandas), Jupyter Notebooks, Excel/Google Sheets for initial exploration.
- **Success Criteria:** Dataset is cleaned, normalized, and ready for analysis with <5% missing data.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring data quality issues leading to misleading trends.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Action:** Perform EDA using statistical summaries, visualizations via Matplotlib/Seaborn, and correlation analysis.
- **Tools Needed:** Python (NumPy, Pandas), Tableau for interactive dashboards.
- **Success Criteria:** Generate insights on data distribution, seasonality patterns, and initial trend indicators.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking null values or using incorrect visualization types leading to misinterpretation.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 3: Trend Detection Modeling**
- **Action:** Implement time series models (ARIMA) and ML algorithms (Random Forest) for predictive modeling.
- **Tools Needed:** Python (StatsModels, Scikit-Learn), R Studio for statistical analysis.
- **Success Criteria:** Model achieves >80% accuracy in trend prediction with cross-validation metrics.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overfitting the model or using inappropriate data splits leading to poor generalization.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 4: Visualization and Reporting**
- **Action:** Create visual dashboards showcasing trends, key performance indicators (KPIs), and predictive insights.
- **Tools Needed:** Tableau for interactive reports, Power BI for web-based dashboards.
- **Success Criteria:** Dashboard is user-friendly, clearly communicates findings with data annotations explaining methodology.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inadequate data labeling or confusing visualizations leading to misinterpretation.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 5: Validation and Iteration**
- **Action:** Validate model predictions against actual outcomes over the last quarter; iterate based on feedback.
- **Tools Needed:** SQL for querying historical data, Excel for comparison sheets.
- **Success Criteria:** Model accuracy improves to >85% after validation with no significant deviations from actual KPIs.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Assuming future performance will mirror past trends without adjusting for external factors.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

**STEP 6: Deployment and Monitoring**
- **Action:** Deploy the model in a production environment (e.g., Azure ML) for real-time trend monitoring.
- **Tools Needed:** Azure Machine Learning, AWS Lambda functions for automated predictions.
- **Success Criteria:** Model updates automatically with new data; alerts trigger when trends deviate beyond set thresholds.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Failing to monitor model performance leading to drift or degradation over time.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 7: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer**
- **Action:** Document the entire process, including code snippets, visualizations, and decision logs.
- **Tools Needed:** Confluence for documentation, Git for version control of code.
- **Success Criteria:** Comprehensive documentation is accessible to stakeholders with clear sections on methodology, results, and next steps.
