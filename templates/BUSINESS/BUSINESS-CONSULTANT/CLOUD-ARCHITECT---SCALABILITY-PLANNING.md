- **Tools Needed:** AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Cloudflare Workers.
- **Success Criteria:** No increase in latency; Cost savings demonstrated compared to traditional VM deployments.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Cold start issues impacting performance during scale events.

- **Tools Needed:** CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Prometheus, Grafana Dashboards.
- **Success Criteria:** Real-time visibility into system health; Alerts configured for critical issues without overwhelming stakeholders with noise.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Insufficient logging leading to delayed detection of scaling problems.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

#### Step 7: Conducting Load Testing & Optimization
- **Action:** Perform comprehensive load testing against the deployed architecture. Analyze results and adjust auto-scaling policies or infrastructure as needed.
- **Tools Needed:** k6, JMeter, Locust.
- **Success Criteria:** Achieved target latency under peak load; No more than 1% of requests failed during tests.

   - *Symptoms:* Incomplete backups recorded by the backup tool.
   - *Cause:* Incorrect schedule settings or insufficient storage capacity in backup repositories.
   - *Resolution:* Verify backup schedules and ensure adequate storage; Consider using more cost-effective tiering for older backups.

4. **Security Violations:**
   - *Symptoms:* Alerts from security monitoring tools indicating potential breaches.
   - *Cause:* Misconfigured network rules, IAM policies, or exposed services.
   - *Resolution:* Review configuration changes; Implement least privilege access principles and regularly audit IAM roles.

5. **Cost Overruns:**
   - *Symptoms:* Unexpected increases in cloud spend reports.
   - *Cause:* Unused resources, over-allocated compute instances, or lack of cost optimization practices.
   - *Resolution:* Regularly review resource utilization metrics; Implement rightsizing recommendations and use reserved instances for steady workloads.
