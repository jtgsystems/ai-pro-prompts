### PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

#### Performance Metrics
Define how to measure success:

1. **Primary Metric:** Folder Structure Completeness  
   - Target: 100% of case files in designated folders.  
   - Measurement Method: Automated scan using a script that checks file locations against folder tree.

2. **Secondary Metrics:**  
   - Security Compliance Score (out of 100) based on audit results.  
   - AI Tagging Accuracy (percentage of documents correctly tagged).  
   - Collaboration Efficiency (average time to resolve shared document conflicts).

3. **Long-term Metrics:**  
   - Time Reduction in Case Management Tasks (hours/month before vs after implementation).  
   - Client Satisfaction with Document Delivery (NPS score from annual survey).

#### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance against targets.
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities (e.g., low tagging accuracy, frequent access errors).
3. Implement changes:
   - Refine AI algorithms for better document classification.
   - Adjust folder permissions based on user activity logs.
4. Re-measure to confirm improvements.
5. Repeat until all primary and secondary metrics meet targets.
