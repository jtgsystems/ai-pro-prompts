- **Success Criteria:** All chosen frameworks are installed and configured in each environment.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Framework version mismatches across environments.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days

#### STEP 3: [Write Initial Test Cases]
- **Action:** Identify critical functionalities to test (user authentication, data persistence, API endpoints).
- **Tools Needed:** Whiteboard sessions with stakeholders, feature mapping tools like Coggle.
- **Success Criteria:** A list of initial test cases is created and reviewed by the development team.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking edge cases or security vulnerabilities.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

#### STEP 4: [Automate Test Execution]
- **Action:** Write scripts to run tests automatically on each commit using CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, Jenkins).
- **Tools Needed:** GitHub Actions, Jenkins pipeline configuration.
- **Success Criteria:** Tests pass in the CI environment without manual intervention.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Environment variable mismatches causing test failures.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

#### STEP 5: [Integrate with Development Workflow]
- **Action:** Add test running step to developers' local workflows using scripts or pre-commit hooks.
- **Tools Needed:** npm scripts, VS Code extensions.
- **Success Criteria:** Developers can run all tests locally before committing code.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Tests not triggering due to incorrect script paths.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

#### STEP 6: [Implement Continuous Testing]
- **Action:** Schedule nightly runs of all tests across all environments and branches.
- **Tools Needed:** GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD.
- **Success Criteria:** Nightly reports show successful test runs across all environments.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missed deployments causing tests to run on stale code.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing

#### STEP 7: [Expand Test Coverage]
- **Action:** Add more tests for uncovered functionalities, focusing on critical paths and edge cases.
- **Tools Needed:** Code coverage tools (e.g., Istanbul), test management platforms.
- **Success Criteria:** Target coverage of 95% is achieved across all applications.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incomplete coverage due to overlooked modules or services.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing

#### STEP 8: [Maintain and Refactor Tests]
- **Action:** Regularly review tests for duplication, update them with changes in application logic, remove deprecated tests.

## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

### Performance Metrics
Define how to measure success:

1. **Primary Metric:** Code Coverage Percentage  
   - Target: 95% coverage across all applications and environments.  
   - Measurement Method: Use Istanbul or JaCooco for JavaScript/TypeScript projects, and JaCooco for Java-based backend services.

2. **Secondary Metrics:**  
   - Number of failed tests per run (aim for <1%).  
   - Time to detect regression issues (goal within 24 hours).  
   - Frequency of test maintenance required (target less than once a month).

3. **Long-term Metrics:**  
   - Reduction in deployment time due to automated testing.  
   - Increase in developer productivity (e.g., commits per week, defect rate post-deployment).

### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance metrics against targets.
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities:
   - Insufficient coverage of critical paths.
   - High number of flaky tests.
   - Slow test execution times.
3. Implement changes (e.g., add more tests, refactor flaky tests).
4. Re-measure to confirm improvements.
