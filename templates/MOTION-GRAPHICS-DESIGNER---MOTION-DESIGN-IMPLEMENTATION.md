- Tools Needed: Adobe Spark, Figma for prototyping.
- Success Criteria: Approved concept by client based on visual references.
- Common Pitfalls: Lack of feedback leading to revisions.
- Time Estimate: 3 days

**STEP 3: Asset Creation**
- Action: Design static frames using Blender or Cinema 4D Lite.
- Tools Needed: Blender (free), Adobe After Effects for final compositing.
- Success Criteria: All assets exported in optimized formats (GIF, MP4).
- Common Pitfalls: Export settings causing file size issues.
- Time Estimate: 5 days

**STEP 4: Animation Development**
- Action: Animate assets using keyframes and effects in After Effects.
- Tools Needed: Adobe After Effects.
- Success Criteria: All animations reviewed and approved by client.
- Common Pitfalls: Overuse of motion causing disorientation.
- Time Estimate: 6 days

**STEP 5: Audio Integration**
- Action: Overlay voiceovers or background music using Audacity or Adobe Audition.
- Tools Needed: Audacity (free), Adobe Audition (optional).
- Success Criteria: Synced audio without clipping.
- Common Pitfalls: Unintended audio artifacts due to compression settings.
- Time Estimate: 2 days

**STEP 6: Prototyping & Testing**
- Action: Build a prototype using Figma or Principle for client review.
- Tools Needed: Figma (free core features), Principle.
- Success Criteria: Interactive preview sent with detailed notes on feedback incorporated.
- Common Pitfalls: Breakage in the final production version due to prototyping changes.
- Time Estimate: 3 days

**STEP 7: Final Rendering & Optimization**
- Action: Render final assets at multiple resolutions for different platforms.
- Tools Needed: Adobe Media Encoder, VLC for testing.
- Success Criteria: All renders meet client's specifications and pass quality checks.
- Common Pitfalls: Unexpected render errors due to outdated codecs.
- Time Estimate: 2 days

**STEP 8: Delivery & Feedback Loop**
- Action: Deliver final files to client via Google Drive or Dropbox.
- Tools Needed: Google Drive (free), Dropbox Business (optional).
