- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours

#### STEP 2: [Initial Translation]
- **Action:** Assign segments to translators based on language pair and specialization.
- **Tools Needed:** Tandem, Lingoda (for language exchange), Google Docs for collaborative editing.
- **Success Criteria:** Initial translation complete with quality checks passed.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of context leading to mistranslations; Insufficient review cycles.
- **Time Estimate:** 8 hours

#### STEP 3: [Review and Localization]
- **Action:** Perform linguistic QA, cultural adaptation, and formatting validation.
- **Tools Needed:** Grammarly, ProWritingAid for grammar checks; Cultural consultants via Zoom or Teams.
- **Success Criteria:** All documents pass final QA with zero critical errors.
