- **Tools Needed:** Google Forms, Kahoot!, Quizizz (free tier).  
- **Success Criteria:** Formative assessments provide real-time data and feedback to adjust instruction.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-reliance on multiple-choice questions that don't measure deeper understanding.  
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours  

**STEP 4: Design Summative Assessments**
- **Action:** Develop summative assessments (e.g., tests, projects) ensuring they are aligned with standards and learning objectives.  
- **Tools Needed:** Canvas LMS for rubric creation, Canva for project-based assessment design.  
- **Success Criteria:** Summative assessments accurately measure mastery of content and are secure against cheating.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Assessments too lengthy or not properly aligned to state standards.  
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours  

**STEP 5: Integrate Technology**
- **Action:** Incorporate digital tools for assessment delivery, grading, and analytics (e.g., Quizizz, Edpuzzle).  
- **Tools Needed:** Canvas LMS, Quizizz (free tier), Google Classroom.  
- **Success Criteria:** Technology enhances accessibility, engagement, and efficiency of assessments.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Technical issues disrupting assessment flow or data security breaches.  
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours  

**STEP 6: Pilot Assessments**
- **Action:** Administer pilot assessments to a small group of students and gather feedback.  
- **Tools Needed:** Google Forms for survey, LMS grading tools.  
- **Success Criteria:** Feedback informs revisions; at least 80% of students find the assessment fair and accessible.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of diverse student input or rushed implementation without debriefing.  
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours  

**STEP 7: Refine Assessments**
- **Action:** Use pilot feedback to revise assessments, focusing on clarity, fairness, and alignment with objectives.  
- **Tools Needed:** Same as Step 5; Google Docs for version control.  
- **Success Criteria:** Revised assessments improve validity and reliability scores (e.g., Cronbach's alpha > .7).  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking minor changes that significantly impact assessment integrity.  
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours  

**STEP 8: Implement Assessments**
- **Action:** Roll out refined assessments to the full student population with clear instructions and technical support available.  
- **Tools Needed:** LMS announcements, instructional videos in Loom (free), chat channels on Slack/Firefox Groups.  
- **Success Criteria:** All students receive consistent, high-quality assessment experience; technical issues resolved within 24 hours of report.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inconsistent instructions leading to confusion or unequal grading standards.  
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing  

**STEP 9: Analyze Assessment Data**
- **Action:** Collect and analyze data from assessments using statistical methods in Excel/Google Sheets or advanced analytics platforms like RStudio Cloud.  
- **Tools Needed:** Google Sheets, SPSS (optional), Python/R notebooks.  
- **Success Criteria:** Data-driven insights inform instructional adjustments; at least 90% of students show measurable improvement.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Misinterpreting data leading to ineffective instruction changes.  
- **Time Estimate:** Weekly  

**STEP 10: Review and Iterate**
- **Action:** Conduct a formal review of assessment effectiveness using pre-determined metrics (e.g., student performance, engagement).  
- **Tools Needed:** LMS analytics dashboards, Google Forms for post-assessment surveys.  
- **Success Criteria:** At least one measurable improvement in student learning per academic cycle; plan for next iteration defined.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of accountability or inertia preventing change.  
- **Time Estimate:** Bi-weekly
