### Research Consolidation
After all sub-agents complete their research:
1. Synthesize findings into a unified strategy document outlining the most relevant insights for wireframe development.
2. Identify any conflicting recommendations or emerging best practices.
3. Prioritize actionable items based on impact and feasibility.
4. Create a master action plan detailing steps to implement these insights.

## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process
**STEP 1: [Project Setup]**
- **Action:** Define project scope, create user personas, establish design brief.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma, Miro (for brainstorming), Google Docs/Confluence for documentation.
- **Success Criteria:** Clear understanding of the project's goals and audience defined; initial sketches and wireframes created.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking specific audience needs or device constraints; inadequate sketching practice leading to incomplete designs.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 2: [Research Integration]**
- **Action:** Integrate insights from research into the project brief, updating user personas and journey maps as necessary.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma, Notion (for collaborative note-taking), Slack for team communication.
- **Success Criteria:** All critical findings are reflected in the design documentation; any gaps noted have been addressed with additional resources or clarifications.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring research insights due to time constraints or personal bias.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 3: [Wireframe Ideation]**
- **Action:** Conduct brainstorming sessions, sketch initial wireframes on paper or digitally using Figma's free design tools.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma (free tier), Paper or digital sketch app like Sketchbook.
- **Success Criteria:** At least three concepts for each screen are sketched; basic layout and functionality of key screens are documented.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not iterating enough on initial sketches; failing to consider different user interactions.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days

**STEP 4: [Digital Wireframe Creation]**
- **Action:** Translate hand-drawn concepts into digital wireframes using Figma, ensuring responsiveness across devices and accessibility standards.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma (free), InVision or Zeplin for prototyping and sharing with stakeholders.
- **Success Criteria:** All key screens are represented in a digital format; the design is tested on multiple screen sizes to ensure consistency.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking specific device resolutions; not verifying accessibility features like contrast ratios or keyboard navigation support.
- **Time Estimate:** 5 days

**STEP 5: [Prototyping and Usability Testing]**
- **Action:** Create an interactive prototype using Figma's prototyping tools, then conduct usability tests with a small group of target users.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma (for prototyping), UserTesting or Lookback for remote testing sessions.
- **Success Criteria:** Feedback loop closed; at least 80% of test participants find the interface intuitive and meet core task completion rates.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Relying solely on expert feedback without user input; failing to update designs based on real-world feedback.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days

**STEP 6: [Iterative Refinement]**
- **Action:** Based on usability testing, refine wireframes focusing on user flow improvements and accessibility enhancements.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma (for iterative changes), InVision for updated prototypes.
- **Success Criteria:** Wireframes are adjusted to address specific feedback; the design is ready for handoff to developers with clear documentation of components and interactions.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking minor but crucial details like icon sizing or margin adjustments; not documenting all changes made during iterations.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days

**STEP 7: [Final Review and Handoff]**
- **Action:** Conduct a final review with stakeholders to ensure alignment on design decisions, then prepare handoff documentation for developers (e.g., component library, interaction specifications).
- **Tools Needed:** Figma (for reviewing the finalized designs), Confluence or Google Docs for handoff documents.
- **Success Criteria:** All stakeholders are satisfied with the wireframes; developers receive comprehensive instructions and assets needed to implement the design.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Last-minute changes requested by stakeholders that aren't captured in documentation; incomplete handoff leading to development delays.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 8: [Documentation and Knowledge Transfer]**
- **Action:** Create detailed documentation including user personas, interaction specifications, and design decisions rationale for future reference.
- **Tools Needed:** Confluence, Google Docs.
- **Success Criteria:** All documents are stored in the shared repository; a knowledge transfer session is scheduled with team members.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Documentation not being updated when changes occur during development; lack of stakeholder involvement in the documentation process.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day
