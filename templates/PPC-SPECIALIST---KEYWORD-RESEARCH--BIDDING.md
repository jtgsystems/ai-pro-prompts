- **Tools Needed:** Google Ads, Excel/Google Sheets for organization.  
- **Success Criteria:** All campaigns live with at least 50 keywords per campaign; keyword list covers primary intent queries related to products/services.

- **Common Pitfalls:** Focusing only on volume and neglecting conversion potential.

- **Success Criteria:** Selected keywords achieving CTR > 1.5% and conversion rate > 3%.  
- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-testing leading to account restrictions or budget burnout.
