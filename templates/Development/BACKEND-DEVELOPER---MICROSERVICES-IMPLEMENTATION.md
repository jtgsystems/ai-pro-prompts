### 2. Execution Steps

1. **Define Service Boundaries**: Identify clear business capabilities that each microservice will own.
2. **Design APIs**: Design RESTful or GraphQL APIs for communication between services.
3. **Select a Containerization Tool**: Choose Docker to package your application and its dependencies.
4. **Set Up Orchestration**: Use Kubernetes to manage the deployment, scaling, and operations of containerized applications.
5. **Implement Service Mesh**: If needed, set up a service mesh like Istio for service-to-service communication management.
6. **Develop Services**: Build individual microservices based on defined boundaries and APIs.
7. **Containerize Services**: Package each microservice using Docker.
8. **Deploy to Kubernetes**: Push the containerized services to your Kubernetes cluster.
9. **Implement CI/CD Pipelines**: Set up pipelines for automated testing, building, and deploying of microservices.
10. **Monitor and Log**: Integrate monitoring and logging solutions to track service health and performance.

### 3. Specific Tools, Software, and Platforms

### 4. Measurable Success Criteria

1. **Service Availability**: Each microservice is available and responsive under load.
2. **Performance Metrics**: Achieve specific performance metrics (e.g., response time < 200ms).
3. **Scalability**: Services can scale horizontally without significant downtime or resource contention.
4. **Reliability**: High availability with minimal service interruptions, automated recovery from failures.
5. **Security Compliance**: Adherence to security best practices and compliance standards.
6. **Observability**: Complete visibility into the health and performance of all services.

### 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Service Dependency Errors**: Use Service Mesh features like retries and timeouts to handle circuit breakers.
- **Resource Exhaustion**: Monitor resource usage via Kubernetes dashboards or Prometheus alerts.
- **Deployment Failures**: Check deployment logs for issues; ensure Docker images are correctly tagged and pushed.
- **Performance Bottlenecks**: Identify slow services using distributed tracing tools like Jaeger or Zipkin.
