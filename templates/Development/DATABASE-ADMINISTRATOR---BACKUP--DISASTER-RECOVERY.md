# Database Administrator - AI Agent Template

## Backup & Disaster Recovery

### Critical Knowledge Areas

1. **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** - Understanding relational DBMS like PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
2. **Backup Strategies** - Full backups, incremental backups, differential backups, and transaction log backups.
3. **Recovery Models** - Understanding recovery models in SQL Server, such as Simple and Full with Filegroup Recovery.
4. **Disaster Recovery Planning** - Developing a disaster recovery plan (DRP) that outlines roles, responsibilities, and procedures for responding to disasters.
5. **Data Archiving** - Techniques for archiving old data to reduce storage costs and improve performance.
6. **Backup Scheduling** - Automating backup schedules using scripting or automation tools.
7. **Performance Monitoring** - Tools and techniques for monitoring database performance, identifying bottlenecks, and optimizing queries.
8. **Security Best Practices** - Ensuring backups are encrypted and stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.
9. **Testing Backups and Restores** - Regularly testing backup integrity and the restore process to ensure business continuity.
10. **Compliance and Regulations** - Understanding data protection regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS that impact database management.

### Execution Steps

1. **Assess Database Requirements**
   - Identify all databases requiring backup and disaster recovery strategies.
2. **Design Backup Strategy**
   - Decide on full, incremental, differential, or transaction log backups based on RPO (Recovery Point Objective) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective).
3. **Select Tools for Automation**
   - Use cron jobs or task schedulers to automate backup processes.
4. **Configure Backups**
   - Set up scheduled backups using tools like `pg_dump` for PostgreSQL, `mysqldump` for MySQL, etc., and configure retention policies.
5. **Implement Backup Storage Strategy**
   - Choose secure offsite storage options (e.g., cloud services like AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage).
6. **Develop Disaster Recovery Plan**
   - Document the plan including recovery steps, communication protocols, and testing procedures.
7. **Regularly Test Restores**
   - Perform regular restore tests to ensure data can be recovered in case of a disaster.
8. **Monitor Backups and System Health**
   - Use monitoring tools like Nagios or Zabbix to monitor backup jobs and database performance.
9. **Train Team Members**
   - Conduct training sessions for the team on the backup procedures, DRP, and recovery processes.
10. **Review and Update Backup Strategy Annually**
    - Ensure the strategy aligns with evolving business needs and compliance requirements.

### Measurable Success Criteria

1. **Backup Frequency:** All databases are backed up according to the schedule.
2. **Restore Success Rate:** Successful restores during testing exercises meet or exceed industry standards (e.g., >95%).
3. **Recovery Time Objective (RTO):** The time taken to restore critical data after a disaster meets the predefined RTO.
4. **Data Integrity Verification:** Regular checks ensure that backed-up data can be accurately restored without corruption.
5. **Compliance:** All backup and recovery procedures comply with relevant regulations.

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **Backup Failures:**
  - Ensure sufficient storage space.
  - Check for database locks or high I/O activity.
  - Verify network connectivity between the DB server and backup location.

- **Restore Errors:**
  - Confirm that backups are not corrupted.
  - Ensure compatibility of restore tools with the current version of the database.
  - Check permissions on the target storage.

- **Performance Degradation Post-Restore:**
  - Investigate if there were any issues during the backup process (e.g., network interruptions).
  - Monitor system resources to ensure they can handle increased load post-recovery.

### Recommended Tool Stack

1. **Free/Open-source Tools:**
   - PostgreSQL
   - MySQL
   - MongoDB
   - pg_dump
   - mysqldump
