   - Set up branches for development, testing, and production environments.

4. **Learn Configuration Management**:
   - Choose one configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible).
   - Write playbooks to automate server provisioning and software installation.

5. **Automate Infrastructure with IaC**:
   - Select an IaC tool (Terraform or Pulumi).
   - Define your infrastructure as code in a human-readable format.
   - Run `terraform init`, `plan`, and `apply` commands to provision resources.

6. **Implement CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Choose a CI/CD platform (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions).
   - Configure pipelines to automate testing and deployment of your infrastructure code.

7. **Containerization Practice**:
   - Create Dockerfiles for different services.
   - Use Kubernetes or ECS/EKS to orchestrate containers in the cloud environment.

8. **Monitoring and Logging Setup**:
   - Set up Prometheus for metrics collection.
   - Configure Grafana dashboards for visualizing data.
   - Integrate ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

9. **Security Implementation**:
   - Apply security best practices in your infrastructure code (e.g., least privilege access).
   - Implement secrets management using tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

10. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Write unit tests for configuration scripts.
    - Use linting tools to validate the syntax of your IaC code (e.g., Terraform Validate).

11. **Documentation**:
    - Document every aspect of your infrastructure setup.
    - Include setup guides, usage instructions, and troubleshooting tips.

12. **Continuous Learning**:
    - Stay updated with the latest trends in DevOps tools and practices.
    - Participate in communities like HashiCorp Learn, AWS Well-Architected Framework Blog, and Docker Documentation.

### 4. Measurable Success Criteria for "Infrastructure as Code"

1. **Code Quality**:
   - Reduced human errors in infrastructure setup.
   - Improved consistency across environments.

2. **Deployment Frequency**:
   - Increased number of deployments per day/week/month without manual intervention.

3. **Mean Time to Restore (MTTR)**:
   - Decreased downtime and faster recovery times after failures.

4. **Security Posture**:
   - Reduced security incidents due to automated enforcement of best practices.

5. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Identification and removal of unnecessary resources.
   - Efficient allocation of cloud budgets based on real usage patterns.

### 5. Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Terraform Errors**:
   - Resource not found: Ensure the resource was successfully provisioned or check for network issues.
   - Plan failed: Review output messages for errors and correct any syntax mistakes in your configuration files.

2. **Docker Image Issues**:
   - Build errors: Check Dockerfile for typos or missing dependencies.
   - Deployment failures: Verify that Kubernetes/ECS containers are running correctly.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Failures**:
   - Test failures: Review test output to identify failing tests and fix issues.
   - Deployment rollbacks: Ensure rollback mechanisms are in place if necessary.

4. **Monitoring Alerts Not Triggered**:
   - Check alert configurations for accuracy.
   - Verify data is being collected correctly by Prometheus or other monitoring tools.

### 6. Recommended Tool Stack

- **Version Control**: Git (GitHub, GitLab)
- **Configuration Management**: Ansible
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform
- **Containerization**: Docker, Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, GitHub Actions
