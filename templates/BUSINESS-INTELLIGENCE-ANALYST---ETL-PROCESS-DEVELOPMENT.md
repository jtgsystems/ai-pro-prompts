   - Target: <2 hours for full refresh cycles.  
   - Measurement Method: Record start and end times of each run using timestamps.

2. **Secondary Metrics:**  
   - Data Quality Score (based on Great Expectations checks) – 99.9% or higher.  
   - CPU/Memory Utilization during execution – <70%.

3. **Long-term Metrics:**  
   - Monthly Cost per ETL Execution – monitor trends to ensure staying within budget.  
   - User Satisfaction with Data Insights – gather feedback via surveys.

### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance against targets.
2. Identify top 3 areas for improvement (e.g., resource bottlenecks, data quality issues).
3. Implement changes such as parallel processing or additional validation rules.
4. Re-measure to confirm improvements.
5. Repeat until all metrics meet the defined thresholds.
