## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process
#### STEP 1: [Foundation Setup]
- **Action:** Set up development environment including code editor (VS Code), version control (Git), and testing tools (Chrome DevTools, BrowserStack).
- **Tools Needed:** VS Code (free), Git, Chrome browser.
- **Success Criteria:** All tools installed, project repository initialized, basic responsive layout created in a prototype page.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Forgetting to set up environment variables or not having all required plugins/extensions installed for VS Code.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

#### STEP 2: [Initial Design Implementation]
- **Action:** Implement the initial design using mobile-first approach, starting with base styles and progressively adding breakpoints.
- **Tools Needed:** Visual Studio Code (free), Adobe XD or Figma for prototyping UI assets.
- **Success Criteria:** All main content areas responsive across defined device matrix, no layout breaks detected in prototype view on each device type.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not defining sufficient breakpoints leading to overflow issues; forgetting to adjust media query values when resizing font sizes.
- **Time Estimate:** 8 hours

#### STEP 3: [Core Responsive Implementation]
- **Action:** Implement responsive navigation, grid system, typography, and component styles. Refactor existing components for mobile view.
- **Tools Needed:** VS Code (free), CSS Grid Layout Playground, Flexbox Designer Tool.
- **Success Criteria:** Navigation menus collapse into hamburger on smaller screens, main content area adjusts fluidly, text legibility maintained across devices.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Components not collapsing properly; images loading full size causing layout shifts.
- **Time Estimate:** 12 hours

#### STEP 4: [Advanced Features Integration]
- **Action:** Implement advanced responsive features like lazy loading for images, adaptive icons, and JavaScript-driven navigation menus (e.g., hamburger).
- **Tools Needed:** VS Code (free), Webpack or Parcel bundler, Lighthouse performance audit tool.
- **Success Criteria:** All assets optimized for different devices, no layout shifts detected in performance audit, interactive components work smoothly on touch devices.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not enabling lazy loading; images not sized correctly causing FOIT/FOUC.
- **Time Estimate:** 6 hours

#### STEP 5: [Cross-Browser & Device Testing]
- **Action:** Test the website across all defined device matrix using tools like BrowserStack or real devices lab.
- **Tools Needed:** BrowserStack (free tier available), physical devices for testing, Lighthouse performance report.
- **Success Criteria:** No critical errors in browserstack tests, all breakpoints work as intended on each device type, performance score > 90 on Lighthouse audit.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not testing on specific low-end mobile browsers; ignoring accessibility issues revealed during testing.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours

#### STEP 6: [Performance Optimization & Accessibility Check**
- **Action:** Optimize assets (images, fonts), enable compression, and run accessibility tests using Lighthouse and Axe.
- **Tools Needed:** Google PageSpeed Insights API, Lighthouse in Chrome DevTools, Axe browser extension.
- **Success Criteria:** Performance score > 90 on Lighthouse, no critical accessibility issues, ARIA attributes properly used for dynamic content.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not compressing images to <200KB; not using appropriate color contrast ratios.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

#### STEP 7: [Iterative Refinement & QA**
- **Action:** Iterate over feedback from testing phase. Fix any remaining issues and conduct final QA.
- **Tools Needed:** VS Code (free), GitHub Issues for tracking bugs, Chrome DevTools for debugging.
- **Success Criteria:** All critical bugs fixed, performance audit > 90, no accessibility violations.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking edge cases during testing; not properly documenting changes.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours

#### STEP 8: [Deployment & Monitoring**
- **Action:** Deploy the responsive site to staging environment. Set up monitoring for performance and device usage metrics.
- **Tools Needed:** GitHub Pages (free), Google Analytics, Real User Monitoring (RUM) tools like Plausible or Matomo.
- **Success Criteria:** Site live on staging with no deployment errors, initial traffic patterns match device matrix expectations.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not verifying SSL/TLS settings; missing redirects for old URLs.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

### Quality Checkpoints
1. **Checkpoint 1 (After STEP 3):** Verify all breakpoints adjust content layout correctly on both emulators and real devices in BrowserStack.
2. **Checkpoint 2 (After STEP 6):** Ensure performance score > 90 in Lighthouse and no accessibility issues found.

## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

### Performance Metrics
1. **Primary Metric:** Page Load Time - Target < 3 seconds on mobile, desktop.
   - Measurement Method: Use WebPageTest or Google PageSpeed Insights API.

2. **Secondary Metrics:**
   - First Contentful Paint (FCP) > 1 second for mobile.
