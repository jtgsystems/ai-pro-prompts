## Phase 3: Execution Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: [Information Architecture Setup]**
- **Action:** Define sitemap and high-level navigation structure based on core features. Create user personas to inform design decisions.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma or Adobe XD for wireframes, Notion/Confluence for documentation.
- **Success Criteria:** Sitemap approved by stakeholders; user personas defined with 80% coverage of target demographics.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overcomplicating navigation hierarchy; neglecting to validate user personas with real data.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 2: [Low-Fidelity Prototyping]**
- **Action:** Create clickable prototypes using Figma or Sketch focusing on core flows (e.g., login, main dashboard).
- **Tools Needed:** Figma (free tier), InVision for interactive prototyping.
- **Success Criteria:** Prototype passes basic usability testing with 10 target users; feedback logged and addressed within 48 hours.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Skipping high-fidelity review phase leading to redesigns later on; not involving end-users in the process.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 days

**STEP 3: [High-Fidelity Design & Accessibility Review]**
- **Action:** Refine design elements (color, typography, icons) ensuring adherence to accessibility standards. Perform WCAG AA compliance check using Axe Core.
- **Tools Needed:** Figma for visual styling, Axe Core plugin, WAVE web accessibility evaluation tool.
- **Success Criteria:** All critical accessibility issues resolved; final prototype passes automated accessibility checks with 100%.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Neglecting color contrast ratios or not testing screen reader compatibility.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days

**STEP 4: [Development Sprint Planning]**
- **Action:** Break down high-fidelity design into development tasks. Prioritize based on effort and impact using Agile methodologies (Kanban/Scrum).
- **Tools Needed:** Jira or Trello for task management, GitHub Projects for sprint planning.
- **Success Criteria:** Development backlog aligned with design; estimated time to implement each feature within 2 weeks.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Underestimating effort on complex components like maps or animations.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 5: [Design System Creation]**
- **Action:** Document and codify design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) in a shared repository. Create style guide for designers and developers.
- **Tools Needed:** Google Design System Generator, Figma's Style Guide Export feature.
- **Success Criteria:** All components follow consistent styling; developers can import styles directly into codebase without manual overrides.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not establishing naming conventions leading to confusion among team members.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 6: [Development of Core Features]**
- **Action:** Implement core screens/pages (e.g., Home, Settings) following established design system. Ensure responsiveness across target device sizes.
- **Tools Needed:** Xcode for iOS development, Android Studio for Android development, React Native CLI or Flutter SDK.
- **Success Criteria:** Core features work as designed on all supported devices; performance metrics meet targets (e.g., < 200ms frame time).
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not instrumenting code for analytics leading to blind spots in user behavior; not testing on physical devices.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 weeks

**STEP 7: [Usability Testing & Iteration]**
- **Action:** Conduct moderated usability tests with target users. Record sessions and gather feedback on navigation, task completion, and overall experience.
- **Tools Needed:** Lookback or Maze for recording sessions, UserTesting.com for remote testing, Google Analytics/Amplitude for quantitative metrics.
- **Success Criteria:** Usability test results guide 20% of iterations; critical issues resolved before beta release.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not capturing both qualitative and quantitative data leading to incomplete fixes.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing throughout development cycle

**STEP 8: [Performance Optimization]**
- **Action:** Optimize assets (images, fonts), implement lazy loading for resources not immediately needed. Test load times on various network conditions using Chrome DevTools Lighthouse.
- **Tools Needed:** Google Chrome Developer Tools, Lighthouse CI integration, Fastly Compute@Edge for CDN testing.
- **Success Criteria:** App loads in < 2 seconds on average with 3G connection; visual stability passes all tests (no jank).
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not prioritizing performance budgets; overloading UI with heavy animations or assets during initial load.
- **Time Estimate:** Integrated throughout development

**STEP 9: [Accessibility Final Review]**
- **Action:** Run automated accessibility scans using Axe and Lighthouse. Conduct manual testing with screen readers (VoiceOver, TalkBack).
- **Tools Needed:** Axe Core plugin, VoiceOver on iOS devices, TalkBack on Android.
- **Success Criteria:** All critical accessibility issues resolved; final app passes manual audit with no barriers for users relying on assistive technologies.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Skipping end-to-end testing of accessibility features leading to failures in real-world use.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 day

**STEP 10: [Beta Testing & Feedback Loop]**
- **Action:** Release beta version to selected target audience (e.g., internal team, select beta testers). Collect feedback via surveys and analytics.
- **Tools Needed:** Firebase App Distribution for beta releases, SurveyMonkey or Typeform for feedback collection.
- **Success Criteria:** Beta phase resolves < 5% of reported issues; overall satisfaction score > 80%.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not providing clear communication channels for feedback; not addressing critical bugs before final release.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

**STEP 11: [Final Review & Go-Live Preparation]**
- **Action:** Conduct comprehensive quality assurance checks. Prepare documentation, user guides, and support resources.
- **Tools Needed:** QA checklist templates, Confluence for knowledge base, HelpDocs or Airtable for user manuals.
- **Success Criteria:** All regulatory requirements met (e.g., GDPR, COPPA); user manual available in-app and on website.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not accounting for localization needs; incomplete support documentation leading to poor post-launch experience.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 12: [Launch & Post-Launch Support]**
- **Action:** Publish app on respective stores (Apple App Store, Google Play). Monitor analytics and user feedback in the first weeks/months.
- **Tools Needed:** Apple App Store Connect, Google Play Console, Sentry for error tracking, Mixpanel for product usage insights.
- **Success Criteria:** Initial adoption metrics meet targets; critical bugs resolved within 24 hours of report.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Not setting up automated monitoring; not having a clear escalation path for support issues.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing
