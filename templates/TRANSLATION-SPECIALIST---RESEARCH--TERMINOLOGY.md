## PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: [Project Kickoff & Setup]**
- **Action:** Define project scope, select TM platform (e.g., SDL Trados), set up glossary
- **Tools Needed:** SDL Trados Studio (free trial available), Ghotnik or MemoQ for TM integration
- **Success Criteria:** TM selected and configured within 2 days of kickoff
- **Common Pitfalls:** Delayed selection due to vendor demos, missing glossary preparation
- **Time Estimate:** 5 days

**STEP 2: [Term Extraction & Initial Translation]**
- **Action:** Extract terms using TM, create initial translations with machine assistance
- **Tools Needed:** SDL Trados term extraction tool, DeepL API or similar neural MT engine
- **Success Criteria:** Minimum of 80% terms extracted into TM by end of week 1
- **Common Pitfalls:** Manual entry errors, low TM hit rates
- **Time Estimate:** 10 days

**STEP 3: [Human Review & Quality Assurance]**
- **Action:** Assign qualified translators to review critical sections, run QA checks
- **Tools Needed:** ProZ for project collaboration, CAT tools with plugging functionality
- **Success Criteria:** 95% of documents pass all QA checks (plugging score >=90)
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incomplete QA steps, reviewer workload overload
- **Time Estimate:** 15 days

**STEP 4: [Cultural Adaptation & Localisation]**
- **Action:** Perform cultural adaptation on creative content, set up localization workflows
- **Tools Needed:** Localization management platform (e.g., Lokalise), cultural consultancy checklist
- **Success Criteria:** All localized assets pass reviewer approval within designated timelines
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking local nuances, delays in asset delivery
- **Time Estimate:** 10 days

**STEP 5: [Final Quality Check & Delivery]**
- **Action:** Run final QA checks, compile project deliverables, archive TM updates
- **Tools Needed:** Final QA report template, version control system (Git)
- **Success Criteria:** Zero critical issues in final audit, TM updated with 95% of new terms
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missed errors due to rushed delivery, non-standardized documentation
- **Time Estimate:** 5 days

**STEP 6: [Post-Launch Monitoring]**
- **Action:** Track usage analytics of TM, monitor for recurring terminology issues
- **Tools Needed:** SDL Trados statistics module, Ghotnik frequency reports
- **Success Criteria:** Increase in TM hit rates by 10% over initial period, <5% new terms introduced
- **Common Pitfalls:** Lack of ongoing monitoring leading to drift
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing

### Quality Checkpoints
Insert checkpoints between major steps:
- **Checkpoint 1:** [After Step 2] - Verify TM hit rate is at least 80%
- **Checkpoint 2:** [After Step 4] - Confirm all assets pass cultural review checklist
- **Checkpoint 3:** [Before Delivery] - Ensure final QA score >=95%

## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

### Performance Metrics
Define how to measure success:

1. **Primary Metric:** TM Hit Rate
   - Target: 95% reduction in glossary inconsistencies within 6 months
   - Measurement Method: Compare initial vs. final hit rates using SDL Trados statistics

2. **Secondary Metrics:**
   - QA Score: Minimum 95% of documents pass all checks
   - Time Efficiency: Reduce total project time by 20%
   - Cost Savings: Achieve 10% reduction in translation costs through better TM use

3. **Long-term Metrics:**
   - TM Expansion Rate: Increase TM coverage by 15% annually
   - Glossary Growth: Add 100 new terms per quarter to glossaries
   - Quality Compliance: Zero critical issues post-delivery

### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance against targets (e.g., hit rates, QA scores)
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities (e.g., low TM coverage areas, frequent reviewer bottlenecks)
3. Implement changes (e.g., additional training for reviewers, more aggressive term extraction)
4. Re-measure to confirm improvements
5. Repeat until all metrics meet targets
