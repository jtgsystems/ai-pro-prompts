- **Tools Needed:** Zendesk/Freshdesk
- **Success Criteria:** Ticket is assigned to appropriate support tier within 30 minutes.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Misclassification leading to delayed resolution.
- **Time Estimate:** ≤ 30 minutes

**STEP 2: Initial Investigation**
- **Action:** Gather required information (user details, environment specifics) and determine if issue requires escalation.
- **Tools Needed:** Ticketing system notes, IT asset management database.
- **Success Criteria:** Clear understanding of issue scope and priority level.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incomplete data leading to rework.
- **Time Estimate:** ≤ 1 hour

**STEP 3: Diagnostic & Troubleshooting**
- **Action:** Use Sysinternals Suite or Wireshark to diagnose network issues; use Ansible for configuration verification.
- **Tools Needed:** Sysinternals, Wireshark, Ansible playbooks.
- **Success Criteria:** Root cause identified and temporary fix implemented if possible.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect troubleshooting steps causing further issues.
- **Time Estimate:** ≤ 4 hours

**STEP 4: Resolution Implementation**
- **Action:** Apply permanent solution (software patch, hardware replacement) based on root cause analysis.
- **Tools Needed:** Patch management tool, vendor documentation.
- **Success Criteria:** Issue is resolved and user can confirm functionality.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrectly applied fix leading to new problems.
- **Time Estimate:** ≤ 2 hours

**STEP 5: Verification & Confirmation**
- **Action:** Verify solution with affected user; gather feedback via follow-up ticket or survey.
- **Tools Needed:** Ticketing system comments, Qualtrics/SurveyMonkey.
- **Success Criteria:** User confirms issue resolved and satisfaction ≥ 95%.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Miscommunication leading to unresolved issues.
- **Time Estimate:** ≤ 30 minutes
