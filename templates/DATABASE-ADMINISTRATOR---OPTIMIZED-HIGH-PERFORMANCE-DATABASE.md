  - Prometheus & Grafana for monitoring dashboards
  - iostat/eBPF tools for storage metrics
- Success Criteria: Baseline metrics documented with clear targets to improve upon (e.g., <100ms read latency).
- Common Pitfalls:
  - Testing in non-production environment only
  - Ignoring seasonal workload variations
- Time Estimate: 1 week

**STEP 3: [Index Optimization]**
- Action: Identify and create missing indexes, optimize existing indexes, and consider partial/full text indexing for high-traffic queries.
- Tools Needed:

  - Custom scripts using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
- Success Criteria: Reduced execution time of slow queries by >30% as measured in Step 2.

  - Over-indexing leading to write performance degradation
  - Not recompiling dependent queries after index changes
- Time Estimate: 1 week

**STEP 4: [Query Refactoring]**
- Action: Review and refactor top-performing yet inefficient SQL statements. Apply techniques like parameterization, CTEs, or subqueries.
- Tools Needed:
  - `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` with different query plans
  - Query optimization tools (e.g., `Postgresql Performance Analyzer`)
- Success Criteria: Top 10 slowest queries reduced by >50% execution time without degrading functionality.
- Common Pitfalls:
  - Neglecting to test new queries thoroughly
  - Not understanding database-specific locking behavior
- Time Estimate: 1 week

**STEP 5: [Resource Tuning]**
- Action: Adjust DB configuration parameters based on baseline metrics and workload patterns (e.g., increasing `work_mem`, adjusting `max_connections`).
- Tools Needed:
  - Database-specific tuning guides (`postgresql.conf`, `my.cnf`)
  - Benchmarking tools like `pgbench`, `sysbench`
- Success Criteria: Configured settings result in improved performance without resource contention.
- Common Pitfalls:
  - Disabling critical OS-level caching
  - Not considering future growth when setting limits
- Time Estimate: 1 week

**STEP 6: [Security Hardenining]**
- Action: Implement least privilege access, enable SSL/TLS encryption, and rotate passwords regularly.
- Tools Needed:
  - `ldapsearch` or `kinit` for authentication tests
  - `openssl` for TLS configuration validation
  - Security auditing tools like `osquery`
- Success Criteria: No unauthorized access detected during simulated attacks; compliance with industry standards (e.g., PCI-DSS).
- Common Pitfalls:
  - Neglecting to revoke unused permissions
  - Not enabling encryption at rest
- Time Estimate: Ongoing

**STEP 7: [Automation & Monitoring Setup]**
- Action: Implement automated backups, monitoring of key metrics, and alerting for anomalies.
- Tools Needed:
  - `RMAN` or native DB backup tools for scheduled backups
  - Prometheus + Alertmanager for real-time alerts
  - Grafana dashboards for visibility into performance trends
- Success Criteria: Automated systems in place; no manual intervention required for routine tasks.
