## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT

### Performance Metrics
Define how to measure success:

1. **Primary Metric:** Parent satisfaction score (average rating of 8/10 or higher on post-conference surveys)
2. **Secondary Metrics:**

### Iterative Improvement Loop
1. Measure current performance against targets (e.g., satisfaction score, response rates).
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities (e.g., low feedback completion rates, delayed responses).
3. Implement changes (e.g., shorter surveys, reminder emails).
4. Re-measure to confirm improvements.
5. Repeat until ultimate goal of high parent satisfaction is achieved.
