## PHASE 4: OPTIMIZATION & REFINEMENT  

### Performance Metrics  
Define how to measure success:

1. **Primary Metric:** Average Resolution Time (ART) - Target: <2 hours
   - Measurement Method: Calculate ART from ticket timestamps, update weekly.
   
2. **Secondary Metrics:**  
   - First Response Time (FRT): Must be <15 minutes.  
   - Ticket Backlog Size: Should remain below 20% of total tickets in any given week.

3. **Long-term Metrics:**  
   - User Satisfaction Score: Aim for >90% positive feedback via surveys.  
   - Agent Productivity Index: Target >85% tickets resolved without escalation.

### Iterative Improvement Loop  
1. Measure current performance against targets (ART, FRT, Backlog).  
2. Identify top 3 improvement opportunities based on data trends.  
3. Implement changes in a controlled manner (e.g., A/B testing new tools or templates).  
4. Re-measure metrics to confirm improvements.  
5. Repeat the cycle until all goals are consistently met.
