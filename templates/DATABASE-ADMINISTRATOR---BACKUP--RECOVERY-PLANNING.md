- **Tools Needed:** Documentation tools like Confluence or Google Docs.
- **Success Criteria:** Documented backup policy approved by management within 10 business days.

#### Step 3: Select Backup Solutions
- **Action:** Choose between cloud-based solutions (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob) and on-premises storage based on cost, compliance, and performance needs.
- **Tools Needed:** Cloud provider dashboards for cost estimation, backup software evaluation tools like Gartner reports or independent reviews.
- **Success Criteria:** Backup solution selected with justification of costs and features within 10 business days.

#### Step 4: Automation Setup
- **Action:** Implement scripts using Ansible or PowerShell to automate the scheduling and execution of backups.
- **Tools Needed:** Ansible, PowerShell Core, or any scripting language compatible with database management systems.
- **Success Criteria:** Automated backup script tested successfully in a staging environment within 10 business days.

#### Step 5: Security Implementation
- **Action:** Encrypt backed-up data both at rest and in transit; configure access controls to ensure only authorized personnel can perform backups.
- **Tools Needed:** Database encryption tools (e.g., Transparent Data Encryption), VPN for secure transfers, IAM roles for cloud storage.
- **Success Criteria:** Backup process is encrypted, and security measures are documented within 10 business days.

#### Step 6: Testing Restoration Procedures
- **Action:** Regularly test restoration of backups to ensure data can be recovered as required.
- **Tools Needed:** Test environments replicating production setups; database restore scripts.
- **Success Criteria:** Successful restoration tests conducted monthly for all critical databases.

#### Step 7: Monitoring and Alerting Configuration
- **Action:** Set up monitoring tools to track backup success rates, completion times, and alert administrators on failures.
- **Tools Needed:** Nagios, Prometheus, or Grafana dashboards integrated with database health checks.
- **Success Criteria:** Monitoring alerts configured for critical backup failures within 10 business days.

#### Step 8: Documentation and Training
- **Action:** Document the entire backup and recovery plan in detail; train staff on procedures to ensure knowledge sharing across teams.
- **Tools Needed:** Confluence, Google Drive, or SharePoint for documentation; LMS platforms for training modules.
- **Success Criteria:** All team members complete relevant training sessions within 5 business days.

#### Step 9: Compliance Review and Adjustment
- **Action:** Review the backup strategy against regulatory requirements to ensure compliance is maintained.
- **Tools Needed:** Compliance checklists, legal consultation tools if necessary.
