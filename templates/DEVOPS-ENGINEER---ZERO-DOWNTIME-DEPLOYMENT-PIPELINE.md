- **Common Pitfalls:** Dependency issues between services or missing base images.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days

**STEP 3: CI Pipeline Configuration**
- **Action:** Set up a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions to build, test, and package your application for deployment.
- **Tools Needed:** GitHub Actions, Docker BuildKit
- **Success Criteria:** All tests pass; successful artifact is created for each commit or pull request.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Long-running tests causing timeouts or flaky failures.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 4: Container Orchestration**
- **Action:** Deploy the Docker images to a Kubernetes cluster using Helm charts.
- **Tools Needed:** kubectl, Helm
- **Success Criteria:** Services are running in the K8s cluster; rolling updates succeed without downtime.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect service configurations or resource limits causing deployments to fail.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 days

**STEP 5: Monitoring and Alerting**
- **Action:** Implement Prometheus for metrics collection, Grafana for dashboards, and ELK stack for log analysis.
- **Tools Needed:** Prometheus, Grafana, Elasticsearch, Logstash
- **Success Criteria:** All critical application metrics are being collected; alerts trigger correctly in PagerDuty during test failures.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Inadequate retention policies leading to data loss or alert fatigue.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days

**STEP 6: Automated Testing**
- **Action:** Integrate unit, integration, and end-to-end tests into the CI pipeline.
- **Tools Needed:** JUnit, PyTest, Selenium
- **Success Criteria:** All test suites pass on every build; no regressions introduced by new features.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Tests failing due to stale data or environment differences between staging and production.
- **Time Estimate:** 5 days

**STEP 7: Chaos Testing**
- **Action:** Introduce controlled failures using tools like Gremlin to test the resilience of your system.
- **Tools Needed:** Gremlin
- **Success Criteria:** Application remains operational under failure scenarios; rollback mechanisms work as expected.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overlooking edge cases or having insufficient recovery procedures in place.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 days

**STEP 8: Canary and Blue-Green Deployments**
- **Action:** Implement canary releases using Istio to route a small percentage of traffic to new versions before full rollout.
- **Tools Needed:** Istio, Kubernetes
- **Success Criteria:** Rollout succeeds with zero downtime; users experience no degradation in performance or availability.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect routing rules causing partial outages.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 days

**STEP 9: Incident Response Preparation**
- **Action:** Develop runbooks for common incidents like service crashes, database unavailability, and high latency.
- **Tools Needed:** Not specific; document in Confluence or similar
- **Success Criteria:** Runbooks are accessible to all team members; simulations of failures show clear recovery steps.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incomplete documentation leading to confusion during real incidents.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing

**STEP 10: Continuous Improvement**
- **Action:** Review and refine the deployment pipeline every quarter based on performance metrics and lessons learned.
- **Tools Needed:** Not specific

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

**1. Deployment Failures**
   - Check logs in the CI system and K8s cluster for failure details.
   - Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in the deployment YAML.

**2. High Latency or Performance Degradation**

   - Look for network latency issues between services using tools like `curl` and `tcpdump`.

**3. Security Alerts**
   - Verify that all images have been scanned with Trivy or Clair for vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure secrets are not exposed in environment variables.
