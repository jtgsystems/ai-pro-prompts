### PHASE 3: EXECUTION WORKFLOW

#### Step-by-Step Process

**STEP 1: Data Collection and Quality Assurance**
- **Action:** Retrieve historical market data for the past 5 years (daily prices, dividends) from Bloomberg Terminal API.
- **Tools Needed:** Python libraries - Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib; Jupyter Notebook
- **Success Criteria:** All required datasets loaded without errors, missing values handled (<0.1%).
- **Common Pitfalls:** API key expiration, data format mismatches.
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours

**STEP 2: Fundamental Analysis**
- **Action:** Calculate financial ratios (PEG, P/B, ROE) for top 100 listed companies in your portfolio allocation.
- **Tools Needed:** Excel or Google Sheets; Python - YFinance for stock data
- **Success Criteria:** Ratios computed and stored in a master spreadsheet (<1% error).
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect denominator (e.g., using book value instead of equity), outdated financial statements.
- **Time Estimate:** 6 hours

**STEP 3: Quantitative Modeling**
- **Action:** Build multiple regression models to predict next year's returns based on macroeconomic indicators and sector-specific drivers.
- **Tools Needed:** Python - scikit-learn; R for advanced modeling
- **Success Criteria:** Models achieve R^2 > 0.7 with backtesting period of at least 5 years.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overfitting, multicollinearity.
- **Time Estimate:** 8 hours

**STEP 4: Market Sentiment Analysis**
- **Action:** Monitor sentiment scores for top holdings using Google Trends and social media APIs.
- **Tools Needed:** Python - Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), Twitter API
- **Success Criteria:** Average sentiment score > 0.5 indicates favorable market sentiment.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Negativity in news overshadowing positive sentiment, algorithmic errors in sentiment scoring.
- **Time Estimate:** Continuous monitoring with daily updates

**STEP 5: Risk Assessment and Portfolio Optimization**
- **Action:** Calculate portfolio VaR and CVaR using historical simulation. Optimize asset allocation to minimize risk while targeting returns.
- **Tools Needed:** Excel - Solver add-in, Python - NumPy
- **Success Criteria:** Portfolio meets target return with VaR < 2% of current portfolio value.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Incorrect correlation assumptions in assets.
- **Time Estimate:** 4 hours

**STEP 6: Strategy Backtesting**
- **Action:** Simulate investment strategy from the past 5 years using historical data. Track performance metrics (Sharpe ratio, max drawdown).
- **Tools Needed:** Python - Backtrader or Zipline; Excel for manual backtesting
- **Success Criteria:** Sharpe ratio > 1.0 and max drawdown < 10%.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Look-ahead bias in data.
- **Time Estimate:** Varies based on simulation length

**STEP 7: Implementation Planning**
- **Action:** Create detailed action plan for deploying the strategy with live funds, including transaction costs and tax implications.
- **Tools Needed:** Excel - Transaction cost analysis model; Python - Portfolio Tracker
- **Success Criteria:** All assumptions documented and validated against regulatory requirements.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Ignoring transaction costs, underestimating tax impact.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 8: Execution and Monitoring**
- **Action:** Execute the strategy in a paper trading environment for 30 days. Monitor daily performance metrics.
- **Tools Needed:** Bloomberg Terminal; TradingView; Excel tracking sheet
- **Success Criteria:** Daily P&L within expected range, no unexpected drawdowns.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Overtrading based on emotions, ignoring risk alerts.
- **Time Estimate:** 30 days of active monitoring

**STEP 9: Review and Optimization**
- **Action:** At the end of the test period, review performance metrics. Identify areas for improvement in models or strategy parameters.
- **Tools Needed:** Excel - Performance dashboard; Python - Model refinement scripts
- **Success Criteria:** Documented lessons learned, updated model versions with improved metrics.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-adjustment leading to overfitting, neglecting qualitative factors.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 10: Live Fund Implementation**
- **Action:** Roll out the fully refined strategy across live portfolios. Set up automated alerts for portfolio rebalancing and risk thresholds.
- **Tools Needed:** Brokerage platform API; AlgoTrader or similar software
- **Success Criteria:** Live P&L meets target return within one standard deviation of backtesting results, risk metrics stable.
- **Common Pitfalls:** Unexpected regulatory changes, liquidity issues in specific sectors.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing with monthly reviews
