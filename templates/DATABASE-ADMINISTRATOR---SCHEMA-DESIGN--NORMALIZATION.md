- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-normalization leading to excessive joins
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 3: Index Design**
- **Action:** Identify candidate keys and high-cardinality columns
- **Tools Needed:** pg_stat_user_tables (PostgreSQL), INFORMATION_SCHEMA views
- **Success Criteria:** All candidate keys are indexed, with B-TREE as default unless specific query patterns require hash
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing indexes leading to slow queries
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours

**STEP 4: Data Modeling Review**

- **Common Pitfalls:** Over-indexing causing performance degradation
- **Time Estimate:** 3 hours

**STEP 7: Backup and Recovery Plan**
- **Action:** Configure automated backups, test restore process quarterly
- **Tools Needed:** Database backup software (e.g., AWS RDS snapshots), test environment for restores
- **Success Criteria:** Successful restoration of data from a point-in-time backup
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing daily backup schedules or incomplete restore scripts
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 8: Monitoring Setup**
- **Action:** Implement real-time monitoring of key performance metrics (CPU, IO, lock waits)
- **Tools Needed:** Prometheus + Grafana for PostgreSQL, Datadog for multi-database environments
- **Success Criteria:** Alert thresholds set at 80% CPU and 90% disk usage
- **Common Pitfalls:** Alerts not configured or monitored by the team
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 9: Documentation**

- **Tools Needed:** Confluence, SharePoint for version-controlled documentation
- **Success Criteria:** All steps are documented in a single wiki page with diagrams attached
- **Common Pitfalls:** Documentation not kept up-to-date or stored separately
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 10: Peer Review and Approval**
- **Action:** Conduct peer review of the normalized schema by another DBA or architect
- **Tools Needed:** GitHub Pull Requests, GitLab Merge Requests for code reviews
- **Success Criteria:** All critical changes approved without comments
- **Common Pitfalls:** Skipping peer review leading to overlooked issues
- **Time Estimate:** 1 hour

**STEP 11: Deployment**
- **Action:** Deploy normalized schema to production using migration tooling (e.g., Flyway)
- **Tools Needed:** Flyway, Liquibase, or native DB schema deployment scripts
- **Success Criteria:** Schema deployed without errors, all tables created successfully
- **Common Pitfalls:** Missing constraints leading to data integrity issues
- **Time Estimate:** 2 hours

**STEP 12: Post-Deployment Validation**
- **Action:** Validate that application functionality is working as expected with new schema
