### Execution Workflow

#### Step 1: Environment Assessment & Baseline Setting
- **Action:** Conduct a comprehensive inventory of current cloud resources.
- **Tools:** AWS Cost Explorer, Azure Cost Management + Budgets; Terraform Plan output for infrastructure state.
- **Success Criteria:** All active resources are documented with their cost implications and usage patterns.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks (including verification)

#### Step 2: Define Cost Optimization Strategy
- **Action:** Prioritize costs by categorizing resources into essential, optional, and depreciated categories.
- **Tools:** Use cloud provider dashboards for cost breakdown; prioritize AWS Tagging Strategy.
- **Success Criteria:** A prioritized list of resources to optimize or deprecate.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

#### Step 3: Implement Reserved Instances/Savings Plans
- **Action:** Identify candidates for reserved instances based on usage patterns and implement savings plans where applicable.
- **Tools:** AWS Pricing Calculator, Azure Cost Management; CloudHealth Cost Optimization tool.
- **Success Criteria:** Reduction in compute costs by at least 10% within the first month.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks (setup + monitoring)

#### Step 4: Rightsize Instances
- **Action:** Analyze current instance types and sizes, propose optimal configurations based on workload requirements.
- **Tools:** AWS Compute Optimizer, Azure Advisor; Cloudability for instance resizing suggestions.
- **Success Criteria:** Each instance class is justified with a cost-performance tradeoff analysis.
- **Time Estimate:** 2 weeks

#### Step 5: Implement Auto-scaling Policies
- **Action:** Define and deploy auto-scaling policies to scale resources based on demand, using CPU or memory metrics as triggers.
- **Tools:** AWS Application Auto Scaling, Azure Autoscale Feature; CloudWatch Alarms for scaling thresholds.
- **Success Criteria:** Systems can handle increased load without manual intervention and costs align with actual usage.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week (setup) + ongoing monitoring

#### Step 6: Optimize Data Storage
- **Action:** Consolidate storage, use cost-effective storage tiers, implement lifecycle policies for infrequently accessed data.
- **Tools:** AWS S3 Intelligent-Tiering, Azure Blob Storage with cool and archive tiers; CloudHealth Storage Optimizer.
- **Success Criteria:** Storage costs reduced by 15% within the first quarter.
- **Time Estimate:** Ongoing, but major changes in 1 month

#### Step 7: Implement a Cost Monitoring Dashboard
- **Action:** Set up real-time dashboards to visualize cloud spend against budgets and track resource utilization.
- **Tools:** Grafana with AWS and Azure data sources; Cloudability for budget alerts.
- **Success Criteria:** Real-time visibility into spending and immediate alerts when budgets are nearing limits.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week

#### Step 8: Automate Resource Cleanup
- **Action:** Implement scripts to automatically delete or stop idle resources that aren't being used.
- **Tools:** AWS CLI + Lambda, Azure Functions for automated resource cleanup; Terraform destroy commands for critical infrastructure.
- **Success Criteria:** Monthly cost reduction of at least 5% from unused resources.
- **Time Estimate:** 1 week
