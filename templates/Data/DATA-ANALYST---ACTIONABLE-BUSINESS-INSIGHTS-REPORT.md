   - Insufficient missing value imputation leading to biased models.
   - Solution: Use advanced techniques like multiple imputation or consult domain experts for missing data patterns.

2. **Performance Bottlenecks**:
   - Slow processing times due to large datasets.
   - Solution: Leverage distributed computing with Apache Spark or optimize SQL queries.

3. **Visualization Confusion**:
   - Stakeholders struggle to interpret complex visualizations.
   - Solution: Provide context and key takeaways alongside charts, use simpler visuals for critical insights.

4. **Model Drift**:
   - Model predictions become less accurate over time due to changing data patterns.
   - Solution: Regularly retrain models with new data and monitor performance metrics.

5. **Stakeholder Engagement**:
   - Lack of interest from stakeholders in the report's findings.
