   - Ensure data quality through profiling and cleansing.

2. **Data Storage & Warehousing**
   - Design a scalable data warehouse using technologies like Amazon Redshift (optional) or Google BigQuery (paid alternative).
   - Implement ETL/ELT processes to move data into the warehouse.

3. **Data Modeling**
   - Create star/snowflake schemas for dimensional modeling.
   - Use open-source tools like dbt (free) for transformation logic.

4. **Statistical Analysis & Machine Learning Preparation**
   - Profile data to understand distributions, missing values, outliers.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis using Python (pandas, NumPy).

5. **Predictive Modeling Development**
   - Select appropriate predictive modeling algorithms based on business problem.
   - Implement models using open-source libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow (free).
   - Split data into training and testing sets.

6. **Model Evaluation & Validation**
   - Use metrics like RMSE, MAE, AUC for regression/classification problems.
   - Perform cross-validation to ensure model robustness.

7. **Deployment of Predictive Models**
   - Package models using tools like Docker (free) or Kubernetes (optional).
   - Integrate models into existing BI systems for real-time predictions.

8. **BI Integration & Reporting**
   - Design dashboards and reports that incorporate predictive insights.
   - Use open-source BI tools like Superset (free) or Metabase (free/optional).

9. **Data Governance & Security**
   - Implement data access controls based on user roles.
   - Ensure compliance with regulations like GDPR, CCP.

10. **Performance Tuning & Optimization**
