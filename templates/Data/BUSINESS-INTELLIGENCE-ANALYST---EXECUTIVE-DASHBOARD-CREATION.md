### 4. Measurable Success Criteria for "Executive Dashboard Creation"

1. **Accuracy**: The dashboard accurately reflects the underlying data and business metrics.
2. **Usability**: Stakeholders can easily understand and navigate the dashboard without extensive training.
3. **Interactivity**: Users can interact with the data (e.g., filter, drill down) to gain insights.
4. **Performance**: The dashboard loads quickly and responds well to user interactions.
5. **Relevance**: All included metrics and visualizations are relevant to business goals and stakeholder needs.

### 5. Troubleshooting Section for Common Issues

- **Data Quality Issues**:
  - Missing values, duplicates, or outliers can skew analysis results.
  - Solution: Use data profiling tools (e.g., Apache Hive) to identify issues early.

- **Performance Bottlenecks**:
  - Dashboards may load slowly due to large datasets or complex visualizations.
  - Solution: Optimize SQL queries and use data sampling techniques for interactive features.

- **Security Concerns**:
  - Sensitive data leakage through the dashboard interface.
  - Solution: Implement role-based access control in BI tools and encrypt sensitive fields.

- **Model Drift**:
  - Over time, models may become less accurate due to changes in underlying patterns.
  - Solution: Regularly retrain models with new data and monitor performance metrics.
