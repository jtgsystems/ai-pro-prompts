### 2. Detailed Execution Steps with Specific Actions

1. **Project Initiation**
   - Define the business problem and objectives: Gather requirements from stakeholders to clearly understand the goals of the advanced analytics dashboard.
   - Form a project team: Assemble a cross-functional team including data engineers, analysts, and domain experts.

2. **Data Collection and Ingestion**
   - Identify relevant data sources: Determine where data resides (databases, APIs, files) based on business requirements.
   - Extract Data: Use SQL or ETL tools like Apache NiFi for extracting data from various databases into a centralized location.
   - Transform Data: Cleanse and preprocess data using Python libraries such as Pandas or Spark.

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilize Matplotlib, Seaborn to visualize distributions, correlations, and identify patterns in the dataset.
   - Statistical Testing: Apply statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA) to validate assumptions using Pythons SciPy library or R.

4. **Model Building**
   - Feature Engineering: Create new features from existing data that improve model performance.
   - Train Models**: Use scikit-learn for implementing regression, classification models; TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning tasks.
   - Evaluate Models**: Employ metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model effectiveness.

5. **Dashboard Design**
   - Define Dashboard Requirements: Align dashboard goals with business objectives; identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations.
   - Select a Visualization Tool: Choose from Tableau Public or Power BI for interactive dashboards; alternatively, use open-source alternatives like Grafana or D3.js.

6. **Data Visualization**
   - Design Interactive Visualizations**: Incorporate charts, graphs, tables, and maps that enable users to drill down into data.
   - Integrate Models: Display model predictions alongside historical data in the dashboard for comparative analysis.

7. **Deployment**
   - Containerize Application: Use Docker to package the dashboard application for easy deployment on cloud platforms like AWS or GCP.
   - Set up CI/CD Pipeline: Automate testing and deployment using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.
